The clinical manifestation of this infection can be severe enough to cause death. Although pertussis has been supposed to be a vaccine-preventable disease ever since the widespread vaccination of children against pertussis was started, since the 1990s, cases of pertussis and related fatalities are on the rise, especially in countries with high vaccination coverage. In Korea, there have been no deaths due to pertussis since 1990, and the vaccination rate continues to be approximately 94%. However, the number of pertussis cases reported to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention has tended to increase in the 2000s, and in 2009, there was an obvious increase in the number of pertussis cases reported. This review aims to present the latest information about the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of pertussis.\n**Keywords:** Pertussis, Vaccination, Outbreak\n##  Introduction\nPertussis is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ ; this infection is most severe in infants. Pertussis was a major cause of infant death before the introduction of vaccination. There are still 60 million cases of pertussis each year worldwide, resulting in about 300,000 deaths[1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B1). Most of the deaths have been of unvaccinated children from developing countries. However, pertussis cases are increasing in Western countries with high vaccination coverage since the 1990s[2)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B2). In Korea, an average of approximately 11.5 cases of pertussis is reported to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) each year, and there have been no fatalities since the 1990s[3)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B3). However, in the 2000s, the pertussis cases reported tended to increase, with up to 66 cases being reported in 2009[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B4), [5)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B5). Since the diagnosis of the reported cases was confirmed by PCR and culture without serology, the actual number of cases must be much more than 66 in 2009. This trend of increasing pertussis cases is now becoming obvious in Korea. This article was intended to review the latest knowledge about the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of pertussis.\n##  Pathogenesis\nPertussis is a mucosal infection whose pathogenesis is induced by the local and systemic effects of toxins.\nMore than 95% of pertussis cases occur during epidemics and in endemic areas and are caused by _B. pertussis_ infection; the remaining 5% of cases are caused by infection with _Bordetella parapertussis_[6)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B6). _B. pertussis_ is the only gram-negative coccobacillus, and _Bordetella_ spp. possess the pertussis toxin (PT), which is the bacteria's major virulence protein that infects only humans. _B. pertussis_ organisms are acquired through aerosols and have strict tropism for the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract. Attachment to target cells is mediated by filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), some agglutinogens (especially FIM2 and FIM3), a 69-kd nonfimbrial surface protein called pertactin (PRN), and PT. Bacterial survival is aided by ciliostasis related to the tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) and impaired leukocyte function due to PT and the adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin. Local epithelial damage and respiratory tract symptomatology are mediated by the TCT and AC toxins. PT plays a major role in the severity of pertussis cough, encephalopathy, and lymphocytosis by preventing migration of the organism from the circulating blood[7)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B7).\n##  Epidemiology\nPertussis is highly contagious, with attack rates as high as 100% in susceptible individuals who have been exposed to contaminated aerosol droplets at close range. Natural disease and vaccination elicit broad antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. However, neither the disease nor vaccination confer complete or lifelong immunity against the disease or protect against reinfection. Protection against the typical disease begins to wane 3 to 5 years after vaccination and is not measurable by 12 years. When exposed to pertussis infection, over 50% of vaccinated people develop asymptomatic, mild desease[8)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B8) and become a source of infection for infants in whom pertussis may result in hospitalization and death.\nPertussis is a significant cause of mortality in early infancy worldwide, despite widespread vaccination. It remains endemic in many industrialized countries, which have reported increases in incidence during the past several decades. This increase has been mainly among adults and adolescents, and chronic cough that persisted for over 2 weeks was the main cause (20-37.2%), although death and hospitalization from pertussis continue to occur predominantly in unvaccinated infants aged less than 6 months[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B9), [10)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B10).\nIn Korea, the incidence of pertussis has dramatically decreased since DTwP vaccination started in 1958 and DTwP was changed to DTaP in 1982. The number of pertussis cases reported to the KCDC was approximately 11.5 cases each year until 1991, but the incidence of pertussis seems to be on the rise since 2000, although the vaccination rate continues to be over 94%. In 2009, 66 cases of pertussis were reported. The KCDC confirmed that these cases were pertussis by culture or PCR of pertussis from nasal specimens and a positive rate of culture and PCR is very low compared to serologic study. On the basis of the sensitivity of the test and reporting rate in 2009, it can be assumed that more than 2,000 pertussis occurred in 2009 ([Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#F1)).\n### Fig. 1.\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8d57/2994127/373c9273997b/kjped-53-629-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2994127_kjped-53-629-g001.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/figure/F1/)\nNumber of cases of pertussis reported in Korea (1995-2009).\n##  Clinical manifestations and complications\nClassical pertussis has 3 stages of clinical symptoms: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. These stages are only seen in unimmunized toddlers and children. The 3 classical stages commence after 3-12 days of bacteria incubation. Nonspecific symptoms such as rhinorrhea, sneezing, mild fever, and eye infection without significant conjunctivitis occur after about 2 weeks in the catarrhal stage, and these symptoms are followed by characteristic paroxysmal stage symptoms such as a dry, intermittent, irritative hack which evolves into paroxysms. In the paroxysmal stage, a healthy-looking, playful toddler suddenly begins to express an anxious aura and experiences bouts of uninterrupted coughing while drawing a single breath. The coughs are followed by a loud whoop as inspired air passes through the still partially closed glottis ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#F2)).\n### Fig. 2.\n[![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8d57/2994127/e2ae5d7a18e0/kjped-53-629-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2994127_kjped-53-629-g002.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/figure/F2/)\nManifestations and complications of pertussis. Abbreviations : DFA, direct fluorescent antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. Adapted from Cherry JD, Brunell PA, Golden GS, et al. Report of the task force on pertussis and pertussis immunization-1988. Pediatrics 1988;81[Suppl]:939-84.)\nIn infants younger than 3 months, the catarrhal phase usually lasts for a few days or is not recognized at all; the paroxysmal and convalescent stages are protracted, with periods of spasmodic coughing throughout the first year of life. In the paroxysmal stage, young infants frequently present with gagging, gasping, choking, cyanosis, apnea, or an \"apparent life-threatening event\" instead of paroxysmal coughing; whooping is absent.\nIn immunized children and adults, all stages of pertussis are shortened, and it is not uncommon for the disease to not have distinct stages and show chronic cough paroxysms that continue for more than 2 weeks.\nThe principal complications of pertussis are apnea; secondary infections such as pneumonia and otitis media; respiratory failure because of apnea, pneumonia, or pulmonary hypertension; and physical sequelae because of forceful coughing. Pertussis-related complications and mortality are reported, especially in patients younger than 2 months, who have the highest reported rates of pertussis-associated hospitalization (>90%), pneumonia (15-25%), seizures (2-4%), encephalopathy (0.5-1%), and death (0.5-1%)[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B11)-[13)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B13). There are several reports on pertussis as a significant cause of sudden infant death syndrom[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B14)-[16)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B16).\n##  Diagnosis\nPertussis should be considered as a diagnosis in very young infants who have not completed 3 doses of vaccination and have classical symptoms or in children who display major symptoms such as chronic paroxysmal cough without significant fever, general weakness, and sore throat and do not have physical signs such as wheezing and rales. Chlamydia trachomatis infection in very young infants and adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections should be the differential diagnosis for children because despite the abovementioned differences, it is not easy to diagnose pertussis on the basis of only clinical symptoms and signs, especially if secondary infections such as pneumonia are present.\nThe laboratory finding characteristic for pertussis is leukocytosis (leukocyte counts of 15,000-100,000 cells/mm3 due to absolute lymphocytosis in the late catarrhal and paroxysmal stages. The degree of leukocytosis parallels the severity of illness and is mainly observed in unvaccinated children; leukocytosis is not common in adolescents, adults, and partially immunized children with pertussis[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B17), [18)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B18). Chest x-ray findings are normal in most cases, although chest x-ray images of hospitalized young infants may show hilar infiltration, interstitial edema, atelectasis, and, rarely, pneumothrax.\nThere are several ways to confirm _B. pertussis_ infection such as serology, culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, and PCR. All these methods have limitations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, or practicality.\nThe traditional gold standard for confirming pertussis is culture, but many factors that can influence the results, such as the stage of illness, use of antibiotics, cautious posterior nasopharyngeal sampling, adequate transport media (Regan-Lowe) and culture media (Regan-Lowe charcoal media with 10% horse blood or 5-40 µg/mL cephalexin), and vaccination status of the patient. In adolescents and adults with pertussis, culture or PCR test results are positive in <10% of cases that have been confirmed as pertussis by serology. However, PCR is more rapid and sensitive than culture for confirming pertussis[19)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B19).\nSerologic tests use enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect antibodies to components of _B. pertussis_ and are the most sensitive tests for diagnosis in distantly immunized individuals and those evaluated after the second week of experiencing coughs. A 4-fold increase in anti-PT IgG with 4-6 week intervals appears to be the most reliable serologic test, and a single test showing an anti-PT IgG level of >94-110 EU/mL (over 2SD of the IgG level in the community) has been proposed as the diagnostic cutoff point[20)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B20).\n##  Treatment\nThe goals of therapy are to limit the number, severity, and duration of paroxysms and prevent complications. Hospitalization is usually needed to treat infants with pertussis because they need supportive care such as hydration, nutrition, and monitoring for complications.\nIf the patient experienced uncontrolled severe cough along with hypoxia, seizures, and apnea, ventilator care should be provided along with muscle paralysis to prevent bradycardia and cardiopulmonary complications.\nAntibiotics should be given to infants younger than 1 year old who have had the cough paroxysm for less than 6 weeks and to all the patients who began coughing within 3 weeks in order to improve symptoms, shorten their duration, and prevent further infection[21)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B21). Erythromycin is the treatment of choice; 40-50 mg/kg erythromycin is prescribed for 10-14 days. Newer macrolides such as clarithromycin and azithromycin can be used instead of erythromycin and have the same effect[22)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B22).\n##  Isolation and prevention\nSince pertussis is extremely contagious, there have been many secondary cases and outbreaks of pertussis in hospitals and chronic-care facilities. To prevent infection from the index patient, droplet precautions are recommended for at least 5 days after the initiation of macrolide therapy and those who have had close exposure should get the same macrolide treatment as pertussis patients. In addition, children younger than 7 years who did not complete the 5 rounds of pertussis vaccination should complete the schedule of vaccination. Adolescents older than 11 years and adults should receive the Tdap (tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis): booster vaccination.\nThe most important and effective way to control pertussis is vaccination. The current pertussis vaccination schedule in Korea comprises a primary series of 3 vaccinations: the first dose is administered at 2 months of age, the second is a booster vaccination given at 18 months of age, and the third dose is also a booster vaccination given at 4-6 years of age.\nDespite longstanding and widespread vaccination programs, pertussis remains endemic in many industrialized countries, including Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States, all of which have reported recent increases in incidence. Factors contributing to pertussis resurgence remain unclear, but possible causes are waning immunity, improved surveillance and diagnosis, and adaptation of circulating _B. pertussis_ strains[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B23), [24)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B24). Although pertussis is classically a disease of infants and children, the main portions of the population showing an increased incidence of pertussis are adults and adolescents; these infected adolescents and adults become a source of infection for infants. Consequently, pertussis-related mortality increases[25)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994127/#B25).\nTo solve the problem of waning immunity after pertussis vaccination and disease, Tdap booster vaccination for adolescents older than 11 years and adults has been started since 2006 in the United States and was introduced in Korea in 2009.\n##  Conclusion\nPertussis was a leading cause of death of children before pertussis vaccination was started, and the disease continues to be a leading cause of child mortality. The incidence and mortality of pertussis has been increasing since 1990 in developed countries despite these countries having vaccination rates of 95%. After widespread vaccination, the diagnosis of pertussis is difficult because of lack of classical clinical manifestations in very young infants and vaccinated children. In Korea, the prevalence of pertussis might be increasing since 2000 and there was a pertussis outbreak in 2009. No epidemiological study based on serology has been done so far in Korea, and the exact number of pertussis cases that occur and are undiagnosed remains unknown. Therefore, we do not have any weapons to fight against future outbreaks of pertussis, a significant cause of mortality of very young infants.\nTherefore, I suggest that a nationwide epidemiologic study of pertussis be undertaken immediately. The study should aim to develop methods for serologic diagnosis, new devise vaccination strategies to prevent waning immunity and reduce the number of very young unvaccinated individuals, and develop diagnosis criteria for atypical pertussis.\n##  References\n  * 1.Department of Vaccines and Biologicals, World Health Organization.

As a spontaneous reflex arc, it involves receptors, an afferent pathway, a center processing information, an efferent pathway and effectors. The determinant factor of cough efficacy is the operational volume of the lung, which in turn relies on the strength and coordination of respiratory and laryngeal muscles as well as on lung mechanics. Respiratory muscle weakness and dysfunction as well as expiratory flow limitation and lung hyperinflation may occur in some neuromuscular disorders and in obstructive airway diseases, respectively. Accordingly, all these diseases may show an ineffective cough. In this brief overview, we deal with the determinants of the cough efficacy and the clinical conditions affecting cough efficacy as well as the cough’s efficacy measurements in clinical setting. ([www.actabiomedica.it](http://www.actabiomedica.it))\n**Keywords:** cough, cough peak flow, neuromuscular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n* * *\nCough is a natural defense mechanism that along with mucociliary clearance, bronchoconstriction and phagocytosis can effectively protect the respiratory tract from inhaling foreign bodies and by clearing excessive bronchial secretions ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref1)).\nCough may be a voluntary act or a spontaneous reflex arc and in this case involves receptors, an afferent pathway, a center processing information, an efferent pathway and effectors. The receptors are placed throughout the bronchial tree and, although in a lesser extent, also in other areas: ear, paranasal sinuses, pleura, diaphragm, pericardium and esophagus. From receptors the afferent impulses are channeled through the vagus nerve in the medulla oblongata, where they are processed. Then, efferent impulses are conveyed by motor nerves and reach the effectors, which are the respiratory and laryngeal muscles.\nSchematically, we may distinguish four different phases of cough, as a vital reflex arc, the first of which is a part in the afferent pathway while the last three in the efferent one ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref2)):\n  1. _Receptorial phase:_ there is the stimulation of cough receptors that are activated and, accordingly, send an impulse to the center through the vagus nerve;\n  2. _Inspiratory phase:_ that consists in a wide opening of the glottis by contraction of the arytenoid cartilage with rapid inhalation, which involves an average of 50% of vital capacity with wide variations in relation to the stimulus and the type of receptors;\n  3. _Compressive phase:_ that consists in a prompt closure of the glottis following the contraction of the adductor muscles of the arytenoid cartilages with consequent adduction of the vocal cords. At the same time, there is a strong contraction of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles resulting in an increased intrapulmonary pressure and compression of the alveoli and bronchioles.\n  4. _Expiratory phase:_ in this final phase, vocal cords and epiglottis open suddenly for action of the abductor muscle of the arytenoid cartilages, thereby causing the explosive leakage of air from the lungs to the outside. Subsequently, the exhalation continues, favored by the complete relaxation of the diaphragm.\n\n\nIn this brief overview, we deal with the determinants of the cough efficacy and the clinical conditions affecting cough efficacy as well as the cough’s efficacy measurements in clinical setting.\n##  Determinants of cough efficacy\nSince the result of the cough reflex arc is the production of an airflow, the determinant factor of cough efficacy is the operational volume of the lung ([3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref3)), which in turn relies on the strength and coordination of respiratory and laryngeal muscles as well as on lung mechanics.\nThe weakness and/or the incoordination of the respiratory and/or laryngeal muscles may significantly decrease the driving pressure applied to the alveoli and to the bronchial airways. The reduction in driving pressure consequently results in low expiratory volumes and flows during cough. A weakness or a dysfunction of the respiratory muscles are common conditions in many neuromuscular disorders ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#T1)). At the same time the impairment of laryngeal muscles, either in terms of strength or coordination, can significantly limit the development of compression phase and the following increase in intrapulmonary pressure.\n### Table 1.\nNeuromuscolar desease with respiratory muscle weakness\nDiseases of the Central Nervous System | \n  * Parkinson’s disease\n  * Quadriplegia\n  * Multiple sclerosis\n  * Poliomyelitis\n  * Motor neuron disease\n\n  \n---|---  \nPeripheral neuropathies | \n  * Guillain-Barré syndrome\n  * Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n\n  \nMyasthenia | \n  * Myasthenia gravis\n  * Lambert-Eaton syndrome\n\n  \nMuscular dystrophies | \n  * Duchenne dystrophy\n  * Myotonic dystrophy\n\n  \nToxic myopathies | \n  * Alcoholic myopathy\n  * Steroid myopathy\n\n  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/table/T1/)\nThe decrease of operational volume of the lung can be the consequence not only of a weakness of respiratory muscles, but also of the expiratory flow limitation and lung hyperinflation. These pathophysiological features may occur in some obstructive airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tracheomalacia and asthma. Accordingly, all these diseases may be associated with cough inefficacy ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref1)). Expiratory flow limitation and lung hyperinflation may result from different mechanisms, such as bronchoconstriction and/or an impairment of elastic recoil of the lung.\n##  Measurements of cough efficacy\nCough efficacy can be measured by means of the gastric pressure (Pga), as well as the peak flow (CPF) and exhaled volume (CEV) at the mouth during a voluntary and maximal cough ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref4)) ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#F1)).\n### Figure 1.\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/57da/6502102/6f3c49043d2e/ACTA-89-477-g001.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/figure/F1/)\nSimultaneous recordings of gastric pressure (Pga) expiratory volume (CEV) and expiratory flow rate (CPF) during coughs in a healthy subject (**1a**), a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (**1b**) and a patient with COPD (**1c**)\nPga is measured using a commercially available latex balloon catheter, which is inserted through the nose and positioned in the stomach. The balloon catheter is connected to a manometer and the subject is asked to perform 3-6 coughs, starting from maximal inspiration. In normal subjects, Pga values are greater than or equal to 100 cmH2O in women and 130 in men cmH2O ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref5)). The measurement of Pga is an invasive test, which on the other hand enables to directly measure the driving pressure, developed by the synergistic contraction of the abdominal muscles during cough.\nThe CPF is assessed while the subject coughs in a tightly fitting full-face mask, adherent to patient’s face and connected to a computerized pneumotachograph, starting from maximal inspiration. The test is repeated 3-6 times. Healthy individuals of both sexes develop CPF values greater than or equal to 360 L/min ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref4)). Patients with values of CPF under 160 L/min have a quite ineffective cough and require manually assisted cough and/or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref4)).\nCEV can be measured together with CPF assessment. In healthy individuals, CEV values are usually greater than 1 L with an average value of 2.4 L ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref6)).\nCPF evaluation is clinically relevant and it can be considered an overall parameter of cough efficacy ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref7)). Neuromuscular patients with values of CPF less than 270 L/minute are at risk of retention of bronchial secretions and respiratory failure in case of bronchial infection ([8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref8)). Interestingly, as shown in a study in patients with Multiple Sclerosis ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref9)), the cough efficacy as measured by CPF significantly correlates with the disability status calculated by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In patients with stable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, CPF <4.25 L/sec could also predict the risk of ineffective spontaneous cough during a respiratory tract infection ([10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref10)). Moreover, a recent study ([11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref11)) has shown that in patients with acute stroke, higher values of CPF are associated with a low risk of secondary aspiration pneumonia. Up to now, no data has been published on the clinical relevance of the CEV measurement.\nThe measurement of cough efficacy should be a routine assessment in patients suffering from progressive neurological disorders with lung involvement and in patients who are at high risk of an ineffective cough. In these patients, a non-invasive evaluation of respiratory muscles function is required and usually consists in some volitional tests. These tests include the vital capacity (CV) measured both in orthostatic and supine position, the maximum inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) mouth pressures, the nasal pressure during a sharp, maximal and short (less than 0.5 seconds) sniff maneuver, which is a complementary test to MIP ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref4)). The mouth pressure during a maximal whistle is a volitional, non-invasive test, which may be considered as a complementary test to MEP ([12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref12)) and is particularly useful in children having difficulties to perform MEP manoeuvre ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref13)). Non-volitional and invasive tests may be required in non-cooperative patients or in patients providing non-univocal results at volitional tests ([4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref4)). Moreover, in case of a documented impairment of respiratory muscle function, an arterial blood-gas analysis may be requested to ascertain whether a hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure due to a ventilatory pump impairment may occur.\nPatients with a decreased operational volume of the lung due to an obstructive ventilatory defect and lung hyperinflation show a reduced forced expiratory volume at 1st second (FEV1)/CV ratio and an increase in the Residual Volume (RV)/Total Lung Capacity (TLC) ratio. In these patients, the CPF and CEV reduction may also occur without a reduction of the Pga, as a consequence of a normal driving pressure (Figure 1c).\n##  Conclusions\nIn clinical practice, it is a common experience that infections of the respiratory tract are the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with neuromuscular diseases, as well as in patients with broncho-obstructive diseases.\nCough is a reflex arc, which acts as a defensive physiological mechanism against the inhalation of foreign bodies and the pathogens of the respiratory tract. In order to produce an effective cough, an operational volume of the lung should be in the normal range and this fact involves a normal function of the respiratory and glottis muscles as well as requires normal lung mechanics.\nIn order to improve cough efficacy in neuro-muscular patients, devices capable of assisting both the inspiratory and the expiratory phase of cough and of improving the operational volume of the lung are now available. Notably, in bulbar and in non-bulbar ALS patients, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation can significantly increase air flow during cough ([14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6502102/#ref14)). Moreover, in patients with COPD the use of bronchodilators, such as beta2-agonists or muscarinic antagonists, can significantly reduce the exacerbation rate and this effect might be linked to an improvement in operational volume of the lung and, accordingly, to a more effective cough.\n##  References\n  * 1.Bouros D, Siafakas N, Green M. second edition.

The quality of life (QOL) of the patients may be influenced by reflux disease. Diaphragmatic breathing (DB), as well as aerobic exercise (AE), may improve the symptoms of reflux disease, although it remains a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of AE and DB on QOL and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure of patients with moderate to severe reflux. \nMETHODS\nThis was a case-control study that was conducted for 8 weeks among patients with moderate to severe GERD. The block randomization method was designed to randomize patients into three groups (AE, DB, and control) to achieve equal sample sizes. The control group received omeprazole 20 mg once daily. The other groups, in addition to omeprazole, received AE and DB. QOL and LES pressure were measured before and after the study by Questionary and Manometry method, respectively. \nRESULTS\n75 patients were enrolled in this study. Positive effects of DB on LES pressure was approved (_p_ = 0.001). DB had significantly more effects on QOL than aerobic exercise (_p_ = 0.003). AE can significantly improve QOL in patients (_p_ = 0.02) but no significant change in LES pressure (_p_ = 0.38). There was no change in the control group for both variables.\nCONCLUSION\nAE had no effects on LES pressure but can improve QOL of the patients. DB had more effects on QOL than AE, so injured or disable patients with reflux who cannot do AE, can benefit from DB to improve their reflux symptoms. \n**Keywords:** Reflux, Manometry, Diaphragmatic breathing, Aerobic exercise, Quality of life, LES\n##  Introduction\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder worldwide with an increasing trend.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R1) According to the Montreal definition of GERD, it is “a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes symptoms”.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R2) Approximately one-quarter of people living in Western countries have experienced GERD.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R3) In the epidemiological studies conducted in Iran so far, a very wide range of prevalence has been reported for GERD, and also reflux has increased over the last two decades.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R4) Heartburn and regurgitation are the most frequent symptoms of reflux, and also, dysphagia, chest pain, chronic cough, laryngitis, and asthma may be present.[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R5) The main underlying causal mechanism of GERD constitutes a failure in the valvular mechanism of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which normally prevents the return of stomach contents to the esophagus. The diaphragm muscle, the abdominal part of the esophagus, and the acute angle of His are the main structures of the anti-reflux barrier.[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R6) LES pressure plays a vital role in reflux control, as assessed by the esophageal manometry method.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R7) On the other hand, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first step and effective in preventing complications of GERD.[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R8) PPIs have many side effects on the body, and about 40% of patients experienced refractory GERD and have resistant symptoms.[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R9) While laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) is the common way for PPI-refractory GERD,[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R10) patients prefer less invasive anti-reflux treatment.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R11) So, it is necessary to use less invasive, available, and simple intervention to decrease GERD symptoms and improve the quality of life (QOL) of the patients.[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R12) DB exercise by activating the diaphragm muscle can reduce reflux symptoms.[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R13) Some studies evaluated the effects of AE on the symptom of reflux and found contradictory results. High-level AE induced reflux in athletes because the LES resting pressure was decreased.[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R14) Also, Bilski suggested that moderate AE had a positive effect on the gastrointestinal tract and may decrease reflux.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R15) Other studies conclude that moderate AE has no influence on reflux.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R16),[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R17) So, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of AE and DB on LES pressure and QOL of patients with reflux. \n##  MATERIALS AND METHODS\n###  Patient Selection \nThe study started when consecutive patients attending Taleghani Hospital were invited to join after fulfilling inclusion criteria. The study design was before and after with the control group (ethics code: USWR.REC.1396.272). Participants (18 to 50 years old) were included if they had moderate to severe GERD, according to the assessment of clinical severity by Kahrilas definition.[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R18) Furthermore, patients with stable cardiovascular and respiratory system were considered to be included. Exclusion criteria were alcohol and tobacco use, pregnancy, patients with extreme body mass index (< 18 or > 35), or surgery involving the gastrointestinal tract because these may alter the anatomy and physiology of the esophagus and stomach. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the Singhealth Centralised Institutional Review Board before the start of the study. \nAll participants were matched according to age, sex, and demographic characteristics. The block randomization method was designed to randomize 75 patients into three groups that resulted in equal sample sizes. In the control group, omeprazole (capsule 20 mg, KRKA, Slovenia), before breakfast and daily, was used by the participants. In the DB group, in addition to omeprazole, DB was performed, and in the AE group, in addition to omeprazole, AE program was used. The study was performed for 8 weeks, and the patients in each group received their interventions during this period. Researchers contacted the patients through phone calls as well as the traditional face-to-face clinical program. All patients completed the study. \n###  Esophageal Manometry \nThe esophageal manometric procedure was performed by a gastrointestinal specialist in a way that was described by Spechler.[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R19) This procedure (using the Sierra system [Duluth, GA, USA]) was performed with volunteers in the supine position and after at least 6 hours of fasting. The probe had 36 pressure 1 cm apart and 18 impedance sensors 2 cm apart. Pressure calibration was performed at 0 and 300 mmHg and zeroed to atmospheric pressure before the procedure. The probe was positioned through one nostril with at least five sensors distal to the diaphragm. The motility catheter was passed through the nose or mouth until the pressure sensors were positioned in the stomach and while the patient breathed quietly. LES pressure was measured as the mid respiratory level in the area of maximal pressure. \n###  Quality of Life Quetionary \nAll patients were given Quality Of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionary (QOLRAD) at baseline, at the end of the treatment for DB, AE, and control group. This questionary was translated to the Persian language and had good validity. We evaluated the total score to suggest the QOL; the higher score means a better quality of life.[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R20)\n###  Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises (DB) \nDB was performed five days a week and five sessions each day. Each session consisted of 75 respiration. The patient is lying in the supine position and placing a pillow under his knees, putting one hand on his chest and placing the other on the abdomen and maintaining his or her contact with the body. The patient inhales a deep breath through his nose, as much as the abdominal hand reaches the highest point of the earth. Then, he takes out air through his mouth and returns to the first ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#F1)). \n#### Fig. 1.\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbbb/8531940/f1e445c4c5ec/mejdd-13-61-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8531940_mejdd-13-61-g001.jpg)\n> How to do diaphragmatic breathing exercise \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/figure/F1/)\n###  Aerobic Exercises (AE) \nFirst, the maximum heart rate was recorded for each person [maximum age-related heart rate is achieved by subtracting age from 220 (beat per minute)]. For moderate-intensity physical activity, the target heart rate should be about 70% of the maximum heart rate.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R21) Participants run with 70% of maximum heart rate for about 20 minutes for each session. Patients received this program five sessions a week during the study. \n###  Statistical Analysis \nThe study was initially designed to compare the efficacy of AE on the QOL and LES pressure versus DB. However, early into the study, it was noted that most patients recruited had moderate to severe reflux, and the study protocol was amended with the new aim to compare QOL and LES pressure of post-DB patients with AE in all patients. All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was utilized to assess normality by SPSS version 23. Differences in outcomes between two groups were analyzed with ANOVA and ANCOVA; respectively. paired t test was used for considerable differences within groups. Variables were analyzed while the level of significance was set at _p_ < 0.05. \n##  RESULTS\n###  Patient Characteristics \nA pilot study was first performed on eight patients with reflux. Twenty subjects in each group was calculated with a test type I error 0.05 and test type II error 0.20, by using the software PASS 11. \nSeventy-five participants were enrolled and were randomly allocated to three groups. The mean age in AE group was 37.00 ± 9.25years and in the DB group was 42.62 ± 8.20 years. Furthermore, the control group consisted of 13 women with mean age of 40.31 ± 6.88 years. The initial 50 patients underwent DB and AE immediately on enrolment (treatment groups), whereas the subsequent 25 patients were considered as the control group. There was no significant difference in terms of demographic characteristics between the groups ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#T1)). \n#### Table 1.

DB had significantly more effects on QOL than AE (_p_ = 0.003). AE could significantly improve the QOL of the patients (_p_ = 0.02). There was no change in QOL in the control group ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#T2)). \n##  DISCUSSION\nOur study showed that in patients with moderate to severe GERD, standardized DB, and AE exercise training significantly improved the QOL of the patients, but this benefit was greater in DB group. Only DB significantly changed LES pressure. In the control group, we did not find any significant change in LES pressure and QOL. \nWe used two respiratory exercises (DB and AE) as an intervention because gastroesophageal reflux impairs pulmonary function, and reflux is a common disease in patients with asthma and chronic cough that decrease respiratory parameters and QOL.[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R22) Pulmonary desease mortality is still increasing worldwide, which needs special attention.[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R23) The importance of the diaphragm is recognized in maintaining the anti-reflux barrier at the LES. Abdominal breathing exercises have been shown to improve GERD symptoms.[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R24) Because the diaphragm consists of striated muscle under voluntary contraction, patients theoretically can be taught how to control these contractions. In the present study, DB improved the QOLin patients with reflux, similar to what was reported in Ehere study.[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R24) As well, Roman found that DB improved reflux symptoms and decreased the patients’ need for PPIs.[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R25)\nThe other finding of the present study was that DB increased LES pressure that was the same as Carvalho study. They found that respiratory exercise could result in LES pressure enhancement.[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R26)\nStudies that focused on the effects of PPIs on the reflux symptom showed that omeprazole could improve the QOL of the patients, but the QOL of the control group in the present study did not significantly change. Maybe the normal dosage of PPIs should be 40 mg daily to improve the QOL of the patients with reflux.[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R27)\nThe effects of AE to improve reflux symptoms have contradictory results. The main different aspect between these studies is the different exercise intensities: the more intensity, the more reflux. Submaximal and moderate exercise may have more positive effects on reflux symptoms. In the present study, aerobic exercise did not significantly change LES pressure, but Herregods, found that running decreased LES pressure.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R28) It is necessary to say that subjects in Herregods study ran on a treadmill for 30 min at 60% of maximum heart rate, followed by a short rest period and another 20-min period of running at 85% of maximum heart rate. Menedes and colleagues concluded that light or short sessions of physical activity had no influence on reflux symptoms, but in the present study, the QOL of the patients was significantly improved.[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R17) In the present study, AE had positive effects on QOL without any significant change in LES pressure. Maybe change in mental aspects by AE improve the QOL of the patients.[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531940/#R29) Finally, DB had more effects on QOL than AE so, the patients with reflux and some orthopedic problems who cannot perform AE, can benefit from DB to improve their QOL. \n##  CONCLUSION\nDB improved both LES pressure and QOL of the patients with reflux. DB had more effects on QOL than AE, so injured or disabled patients with reflux who cannot perform AE can benefit from DB. \n##  Acknowledgments\nThanks to the Gastroenterology Clinic of Taleghani Hospital for referring patients with reflux and all the participants who made this study possible. \nPlease cite this paper as: Ahmadi M, Amiri M, Rezaeian T, Abdollahi I, Rezadoost AM, Sohrabi MR, Bakhshi E.

This study evaluates the emergence and evolution of IgE to aeroallergens among a cohort of children with physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis and/or showing food allergy symptoms and to examine the relation to asthma development.\n### Methods\nThree-hundred and four children (median age 13.4 months at entry) with food allergy symptoms and/or atopic dermatitis without asthma at inclusion were analysed for IgE antibodies against food-, indoor- and outdoor-allergens and pet allergen components and correlated to the individuals’ outcome on asthma inception.\n### Results\nAt 2 years of follow-up, physician-diagnosed asthma was 19.7% (n = 49) and asthma diagnosed any time was 24% (n = 67). History of persistent cough and asthma of father, combination of milk- and wheat-allergy symptoms and dual sensitization to house dust mite and Japanese cedar were independent risk factors for asthma. Sensitization to dog was the most prevalent inhalant allergen at entry. Asthma children had a higher proportion of sensitization to dog, cat and horse allergens at entry compared with non-asthma children. Being sensitized to both food, house dust mite and pet allergens was strongly associated with asthma (p = 0.0006). Component resolved diagnosis for dog and cat allergens showed that IgE antibodies to Can f 1 and Fel d 1 was common even at very young age.\n### Conclusions\nEarly sensitization to inhalant allergens increases the risk of developing asthma as well as having milk and wheat allergy symptoms. Sensitization to dog, was common at an early age despite dog ownership. Sensitization to secretoglobin and lipocalins and less to serum albumins explained the pet sensitization.\n**Keywords:** Asthma, Allergy, Children, Molecular allergy diagnostics, Pet allergen components, Component resolved diagnosis, Food allergy, Secretoglobin, Lipocalin, Sensitization\n##  Background\nThe combination of atopic dermatitis and food allergy in young children reflect a strong risk for the development of asthma-like disease [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR1)]. Symptomatic food allergy is especially associated with asthma among children with multiple or severe allergies [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR2)]. Approximately one half of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis will have clinically relevant IgE antibodies to food allergens [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR3)]. As atopic children grow older, the majority of allergen-specific IgE antibodies are directed against inhalant sources [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR4)]. Sensitization to multiple allergens along with high IgE antibodies levels are features of severe atopic dermatitis in childhood. The knowledge that children with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing asthma is poorly understood in general among health care providers. This is partially due to the fact that there is a wide variability in asthma development, 10–25%, in the risk estimate in longitudinal studies. A better recognition of the children at highest risk of developing asthma among the group of individuals with atopic dermatitis and food allergy is therefore needed.\nAt present, the identification of a child at high risk might not be possible with certainty. Current research points to some indicators including family history, history of asthma and allergies, early and severe sensitization to some food antigens and to aeroallergens and early viral infection associated with wheeze and adverse environmental exposures [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR5)].\nAn atopic history of early life seems to be one of the key factors to identify an individual’s risk of persistent asthma. Illi et al. reported a cumulative prevalence of atopic dermatitis in the first 2 years of life of 21.5% among a general population of children [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR6)]. When associated with allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis was a good predictor of asthma at school age: the risk was not seen with atopic dermatitis in the absence of sensitization. Sensitization to hen’s egg seems to convey the greatest risk.\nBirth cohorts in Europe, USA and Australia show that early sensitization and severe sensitization are risk factors for persistence of asthma [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR7)–[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR9)]. Little is known about the timing and pattern of sensitization to individual aeroallergen in relation to the development of asthma in children with atopic dermatitis and food allergy. Sensitisation to animal and dust mite allergens are each a risk factor for the development of asthma. There seems to be a higher probability of wheeze for cat versus mite at a given IgE value among preschool children [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR10)]. In the same study, summing IgE levels for mite, cat and dog at age 3 strengthened the risk for wheeze at age 5. Wisniewski et al. were not able to verify that multisensitization increase the risk for asthma [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR11)]. Stoltz et al. have examined specific patterns of allergic sensitization in early childhood in relation to the risk of developing asthma and rhinitis [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR12)]. They found that at 1 year of age only IgE antibodies to cat and dog were significantly associated with having asthma at age 6. Konradsen et al. have in a recent review stated that the prevalence of allergy to furry animal has been increasing in later years and allergy to cats, dogs or both is considered a major risk factor for the development of asthma and rhinitis [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR13)].\nWe hypothesised that early onset of sensitization to aeroallergen in children with atopic dermatitis and/or showing food allergy symptoms beginning within the first years of life is important in order to identify those at most risk of developing asthma.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the emergence and evolution of IgE antibodies to aeroallergens among a cohort of children with physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis and/or showing food allergy symptoms and to examine the relation to asthma development during a 2-year follow up.\n##  Methods\nThis study was based on children who participated in the IRAM (Impact of Rhinitis on Atopic March; UMIN000004157) cohort. The study was a prospective five visit study during 2 years. Beside medical history, children were also recorded for atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, parents’ allergy/asthma and smoking history and age, gender, height and weight. Inclusion criteria for this study were confirmed atopic dermatitis and/or suspicion of food allergy. Suspicion of food allergy was based on clinical history of food-induced symptoms and corresponding sensitization to the food. In uncertain cases oral food challenges were added to determine allergy to the food in question following the procedure for food allergy diagnosis in the EAACI and Japanese guidelines [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR14)]. As oral food challenges were not done in all children, the term “food allergy symptom” will be used instead of “food allergy” throughout this study combining the groups of children with confirmed food allergy and of children with suspicion of food allergy, respectively. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was made by the study physicians based on the criteria by Hanifin and Rajka [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR15)]. Blood samples were taken for specific IgE antibody determinations (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#Tab1)). Physician diagnosis of asthma, (at each visit), was based on the Japanese Paediatric Guideline for the treatment and management of bronchial asthma [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR16)]. A previously known diagnosis of asthma was criteria for exclusion. \n### Table 1.\nNumber of patients and prevalence figures\nNumber of children (entry/1 year/2 years) | 304/270/242 |  |   \n---|---|---|---  \n_Physician diagnosed_ | Number of children (%) |  |   \nAtopic dermatitis (at entry) | 210 (71) |  |   \n_Having symptoms for_  \nFood allergy (at entry) | 259 (88) |  |   \nEgg allergy (at entry) | 232 (79) |  |   \nMilk allergy (at entry) | 128 (44) |  |   \nWheat allergy (at entry) | 75 (26) |  |   \nHistory of prolonged cough | 62 (21) |  |   \nPatients by sex (missing # = 2) | Girls | Boys |   \n106 (36) | 193 (64) |   \nBronchial asthma (after 2 year) | 49 (20) |  |   \nBronchial asthma (anytime during follow up) | 67 (~24) |  |   \nAge in month (at entry)/(sdv) | 13.4/(5.5) |  |   \nPet ownership (at entry) | Dog: 28 (9) | Cat: 4 (1) | Dog and cat: 31 (10)  \nPet ownership (any time) | Dog: 38 (13) | Cat: 11 (4) | Dog and cat: 42 (14)  \n| Sensitization  \n---|---  \nPrevalence and 95% CI %a and total # tested (>0.35 kUA/L)  \nEntry (n = 304) | 1 year (n = 270) | 2 years (n = 242)  \n_Allergen extracts_  \nm3 Aspergillus | 3.6 (1.8–6.4) | 4.4 (2.3–7.6) | 9.9 (6.5–14.3)  \nm6 Alternaria | 1.3 (0.4–3.3) | 1.5 (0.4–3.7) | 5.0 (2.6–8.5)  \ng3 Orchard grass | 4.3 (2.3–7.2) | 15.2 (11.1–20.0) | 27.7 (22.2–33.8)  \nt24 Japanese cypress | 3.0 (1.4–5.6) | 12.6 (8.9–17.2) | 32.8 (26.9–39.1)  \nf1 Egg white | 86.2 (81.8–89.9) | 83.7 (78.8–87.9) | 85.1 (80.0–89.4)  \nf2 Milk | 54.6 (29.5–40.5) | 56.3 (50.2–62.3) | 57.0 (50.5–63.3)  \nf4 Wheat | 44.4 (38.7–50.2) | 45.2 (39.1–51.3) | 50.4 (43.9–56.9)  \ne1 Cat | 18.8 (14.5–23.6) | 25.2 (20.1–30.8) | 33.5 (27.6–39.8)  \ne3 Horse d | 6.3 (3.7–9.9)a | 5.4 (3.0–9.0)b | 7.4 (4.4–11.6)c  \ne5 Dog d | 36.8 (31.4–42.5) | 44.4 (38.4–50.6) | 47.1 (40.7–53.6)  \nw1 Comm ragw | 4.6 (2.6–7.6) | 17.4 (13.1–22.5) | 26.0 (20.6–32.0)  \nt17 Japanese cedar | 3.9 (2.1–6.8) | 24.4 (19.4–30.0) | 51.7 (45.2–58.1)  \nd1 D.pteronyssinus | 30.6 (25.5–36.1) | 57.8 (51.6–63.7) | 74.8 (68.8–80.1)  \n| Prevalence and 95% CI %a and total # tested (>0.1 kUA/L)  \n---|---  \n_Allergen components_  \nBos d 6 | (Milk) | 22.7 (18.1–27.8) | 25.6 (20.5–31.2) | 24.0 (18.7–29.9)  \nCan f 1 | (Dog) | 18.4 (14.2–23.2) | 20.7 (16.1–26.1) | 26.4 (21.0–32.5)  \nCan f 2 |  | 7,6 (4.9–11.1) | 11.5 (7.9–15.9) | 14.5 (10.3–19.5)  \nCan f 3 |  | 9.5 (6.5–13.4) | 12.2 (8.6–16.7) | 12.8 (8.9–17.7)  \nCan f 5 |  | 8.2 (5.4–11.9) | 10.0 (6.7–14.2) | 12.0 (8.2–16.8)  \nFel d 1 | (Cat) | 13.2 (9.6–17.5) | 16.3 (12.1–21.3) | 25.2 (19.9–31.2)  \nFel d 2 |  | 8.6 (5.7–12.3) | 12.2 (8.6–16.7) | 12.0 (8.2–16.8)  \nFel d 4 |  | 9.9 (6.8–13.8) | 9.3 (6.1–13.4) | 15.7 (11.4–20.9)  \nEqu c 1 | (Horse) | 7.6 (4.9–11.1)a | 8.5 (5.5–12.5)b | 10.7 (7.2–15.3)c  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/table/Tab1/)\nan = 271\nbn = 257\ncn = 230\nThe informed consent was signed by a legal guardian and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee in Mie National Hospital, Japan.\nSerum samples were analysed for IgE antibodies using the ImmunoCAP® system according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden).\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SAS® 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA) and R 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,). All tests were two-sided and using significance level of 5%. The Chi square test or, when appropriate, Fischer’s exact test were used to compare proportions. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare specific IgE levels at entry and after 2 year follow up. The effect of demographic variables, medical history and sensitisation to allergen components were jointly investigated using a logistic regression model.\n##  Results\nNumber of patients and prevalence figures are presented in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#Tab1). The average number of allergens that a child was sensitized against was at entry 3.0 (SD 2.4; range 0–13) and after 2 years, 5.1 (3.2; 0–13). Amongst the children that were diagnosed with bronchial asthma anytime during the course of the study (n = 67), the corresponding figure at entry was 3.8 (2.8; 0–13) whilst in the group of children (n = 236) that did not develop asthma the mean number of positive allergens was 2.8 (2.2; 0–13) (p = 0.019). Corresponding figures after 2 years were 6.2 (3.4; 0–13) and 4.7 (3.1; 0–13) respectively (p = 0.025). At entry, among the children diagnosed with asthma 6% were not sensitized to any of the tested allergens, 16% were monosensitized, 30% were sensitized to two up to a maximum of three allergens and 48% to more than three allergens. Corresponding numbers for the non-asthma group were 11, 20, 39 and 30% respectively.\nForty-nine out of the 67 (73%) children that were diagnosed with asthma anytime during the 24 months follow-up time period had an asthma diagnosis at the last visit.\nAsthma were significantly associated with persistent cough (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.75–7.80), asthma of father (2.39, 1.14–5.04) and milk allergy symptoms (2.48, 1.22–5.05), when using >0.1 kUA/L as cut-off.

Children with wheat allergic symptoms did not differ in their sensitization pattern at entry or at 2 year follow up compared to children with no wheat allergy symptoms. The results from the logistic regression were in line with this finding as sensitisation to Japanese cedar and wheat allergy symptoms were associated with increased probability of asthma diagnosis during follow-up, although they did not reach statistical significance (Table [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#Tab2)). \n### Table 3.\nDistribution of patients diagnosed with asthma in groups of patients with (A) milk and wheat allergy symptoms (yes or no) and (B) in groups of patients sensitized or not sensitized to house mite and cedar pollen (yes or no)\nSymptoms of  \n---  \nMilk allergy | Wheat allergy | Number of patients: asthma/total | % Diagnosed with asthma  \nA  \nN | N | 24/137 | 17.5  \nN | Y | 5/28 | 17.9  \nY | N | 19/81 | 23.5  \nY | Y | 18/47 | 38.3  \nH. dust mite | Cedar | Number of patients: asthma/total | % Diagnosed with asthma  \n---|---|---|---  \nB  \nN | N | 36/210 | 17.1  \nN | Y | 1/1 | (100.0)  \nY | N | 25/82 | 30.5  \nY | Y | 5/11 | 45.5  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/table/Tab3/)\nChildren diagnosed with asthma at follow up were significantly more likely to be multi-sensitized to animals compared to the non-asthmatic children at entry (Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#Fig1)).

Totally 48 children were diagnosed with asthma anytime during the study. Mean number of positive allergens among these were 6.3 and 5.7 respectively. Corresponding figures in the non-asthmatic groups were 5.0 and 4.0 respectively. An increased risk of developing asthma (odds ratio = 1.22, CI 1.03–1.45, p = 0.02) was observed with increased number of positive allergens amongst the AD children.\nNinety-six percent (189/196) of the dog sensitized individuals had complete data set for measurements of IgE to Can f 1, Can f 2, Can f 3 and Can f 5 at entry. Overall sensitization to least one of these components was 37% (n = 69). Sensitization was highest for the lipocalins Can f 1/Can f 2 (30%, n = 56) followed by Can f 3 (15%, n = 29) and Can f 5 (13%, n = 25) (Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#Fig3)a).

All these 31 children had complete data set and 19 (61%) were found to be positive to at least one of the components. Forty-three percent (84/193) of the non-asthmatic children were cat sensitized after 2 years followed up and they all had complete data set. In this group 64 (76%) of the children were positive to at least one of these components.\n##  Discussion\nIn this study we examined predictors of asthma among children with atopic dermatitis and/or food allergy symptoms. We found that being sensitized to both house dust mite and cedar pollen or having both milk and wheat allergy symptoms were associated with asthma development during a 2 year follow up. A high proportion were sensitized to dogs and cats and mainly due to sensitization to secretoglobin and lipocalins and less due to serum albumins.\nSensitization to cat and dog components per se were not better predictors of asthma development than sensitization to cat and dog whole allergens. However, Wisniewski et al. found that both Fel d 1 and Fel d 4 were identified as predictors of wheeze among cat sensitized children with atopic dermatitis [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR11)]. One explanation to the different findings could be differences in age in the two study population. Median age in the American study was 7.5 years compared to the median age of 1.5 year in our study [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR11)]. This means that the asthma diagnosis will be based on a much shorter observational period compared to the study of Wisniewski et al.\nHaving milk and wheat allergy symptoms in combination was associated with increased risk of asthma diagnosis during the follow up. Eighty-eight percent of the included children had food allergy symptoms and 47 of them had this milk- and wheat allergy symptoms combination, of which 40% developed asthma within 2 years. In comparison, out of the children with a single milk or wheat allergy symptom 23 and 18% developed asthma respectively. We know from the literature that especially egg but also milk sensitization are associated with development of IgE to respiratory allergens [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR17)–[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR19)]. Few prospective studies have studied the impact of wheat allergy/sensitization on asthma development. Illi et al. showed that early atopic sensitization played a major role for the prognosis of atopic dermatitis and sensitization to wheat showed the strongest association. The group with early atopic dermatitis and wheeze showed sensitization to wheat, cat, mite, soy and birch. Nilsson et al. found that 72% of children with a challenge verified wheat allergy had or have had milk allergy and 75% reported asthma symptoms pointing to a relationship between milk- and wheat-allergy with asthma [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR20)]. The reason why symptoms for egg allergy did not single out as a risk factor for asthma in our study is probably due to that most of the children included in the study had egg allergic symptoms at entry. We observed in our study that sensitization to HDM, pets and food was higher in children with asthma compared with the non-asthmatics. Furthermore we could see that there was a higher prevalence of sensitization to these allergen groups in children with AD than in the non-AD children (79 vs 21%, data not shown). Wisniewski et al. [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR11)] also reported that the prevalence of sensitization to these allergens increased considerable in AD-children less than 2 years of age up to 15 years of age. Even though the follow up period in our study period was limited to 24 months, from 1 year of age to the age of around 3 years we could also observed a clear increase in the sensitization prevalence for many of these allergens. However, the short follow up period and the young age of the children in our study limits the possibility to compare our study results with other longitudinal studies with long follow up periods.\nTypical symptom patterns are important for the establishment of an asthma diagnosis. These include recurrent episodes of cough, wheeze, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, and respiratory infections [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR21)]. We found in our population that persistent cough was strongly associated with development of asthma. Cough is the most common cause for new visits in childhood ambulatory care and it is important to remember that this symptom is not pathognomonic for asthma and may occur as a result of several different conditions. Ongoing attempts are being made to simplify prediction tools for identifying children with wheeze or cough who are at risk for asthma. Pescatore et al. provided a simple, low-cost and non-invasive questionnaire based method to predict the risk of later asthma in symptomatic preschool children [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR22)]. However, we do need objective biomarkers for diagnosing asthma in young children as cough and other symptoms may occur as a result of several different respiratory conditions. Being sensitized to both house dust mite and cedar pollen increased the risk significantly of developing asthma during the follow up period. A limitation of the study is that this finding is based on only eleven children sensitized at this early age and this finding has to be verified by others.\nThe high sensitization prevalence for dog was a surprise and no equivalent data has been found in the literature. This is surprisingly high as only 19% of the children were exposed to dog at home. One possible explanation is cross-reactions between bovine and pet albumins. However, Bos d 6 was positive in 23% of the children but Fel d 2 and Can f 3 were only positive in 9 and 8% respectively. This explanation could be partially true as we could document that monosensitisation to pet albumins decreased significantly over the study period, which might be an effect of development of milk tolerance. Instead the most likely explanation is that the majority of the animal sensitized individuals are genuinely sensitized to the secretoglobin (Fel d 1) and lipocalin (Can f 1). Eighteen percent were positive to the major dog component Can f 1 and 13% to Fel d 1, the major cat component already at entry. We have no similar data to compare this with but the picture looks very different from pet component pattern in older children. Bjerg et al. performed a population-based study of animal component sensitization, asthma and rhinitis in schoolchildren and found that 32% were sensitized to dog and 30% to cat [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR23)]. Furthermore, only 5 and 4 of the children that developed asthma were sensitized to Can f 3 and Fel d 2 respectively, which gives a total different sensitization pattern to animal components. Simpson et al. have described patterns of IgE responses to multiple allergen components using latent variable modelling in association with different clinical symptoms [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR24)]. They found that sensitization to the group with component from domestic pets was strongly associated with asthma. Uriatre and Sastre were able to associate IgE sensitization to the different animal molecules with asthma severity [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5335719/#CR25)]. We could not verify this finding but found that if sensitized to two or more animals at an early age, you are more likely to develop asthma. This seems to be even more likely if you are also sensitized to house dust mite and food on the same time. However, our observation period was only 2 years, which is a drawback if studying asthma development in childhood.\n##  Conclusions\nWe conclude that early sensitization to inhalant allergens increase the risk of developing asthma as well as having milk and wheat allergy symptoms. The most common inhalant allergens causing sensitisation was dog allergen, but prevalence and concentration remained stable over the 2 year follow up compared to house dust mite and cedar pollen. The dog and cat sensitisation was mainly explained by sensitisation to major allergens and not cross reactions to serum albumin.\n##  Authors’ contributions\nTF and MN conceived the idea and designed this study.

Congenital disease, such as malformations and structural deviations of the nasal septum, as well as systemic metabolic pathologies affecting the nose and sinuses, rarely require medical therapy from an Otolaryngologist. \nThe immunological function of the mucosa and genetic factors play a role in the development of disease in the pediatric upper airway tract, especially due to the constantly changing anatomy in this growth phase. Disease description of the nose and nasal sinuses due to mid-facial growth must also take developmental age differences (infant, toddler, preschool, and school age) into account. Epidemiological examinations and evidence based studies are often lacking in the pediatric population.\nThe wide range of inflammatory diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses, such as the acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, the allergic rhinitis, and adenoid disease, play a role in the susceptibility of a child to infection. The susceptibility to infection depends on the pediatric age structure (infant, young child) and has yet to be well defined. The acute rhinosinusitis in children develops after a viral infection of the upper airways, also referred to as the “common cold” in the literature. It usually spontaneously heals within ten days without any medical therapy. Antibiotic therapy is prudent in complicated episodes of ARS. The antibiotic therapy is reserved for children with complications or associated disease, such as bronchial asthma and/or chronic bronchitis. A chronic rhinosinusitis is defined as the inflammatory change in the nasal mucosa and nasal sinus mucosa, in which the corresponding symptoms persist for over 12 weeks. The indication for CT-imaging of the nasal sinuses is reserved for cases of chronic rhinosinusitis that have been successfully treated with medication. A staged therapeutic concept is followed in CRS based on conservative and surgical methods. Nasal sinus surgery is considered nowadays as effective and safe in children. Based on the assumption that adenoids are a reservoir for bacteria, from which recurrent infections of the nose and nasal sinus originate, the adenoidectomy is still defined as a cleansing procedure in rhinosinusitis. 69.3% of the children had benefit from adenoidectomy. \nComorbidities, such as pediatric bronchial asthma, presently play an even more important role in the therapy of rhinosinusitis; therefore, it is often wise to have the support of pediatricians. In western European countries 40% of children presently suffer from allergic rhinitis, in which pronounced nasal obstruction can cause disturbed growth in facial bones. An early therapy with SIT may prevent the development of bronchial asthma and secondary sensitization to other allergens. Therefore, SIT is recommended in treatment of allergic rhinitis whenever, if possible. The assessment of diagnostic tools is for the examiner not often possible due to the lack of evidence. Rhinosurgical approaches are often described in study reports; however, they lack the standard prospective randomized long-term study design required nowadays and can only be evaluated with caution in the literature. \n**Keywords:** nose, paranasal sinuses, childhood, diseases, rhinosinusitis\n##  1 Growth and development of the nose and paranasal sinuses\n### 1.1 Prenatal development of the nose and nasal sinuses\nThe creation of the head is the largest stage in the early development of the embryo and consists of neurocranium and viscerocranium. The human face as part of the viscerocranium develops in the fourth to tenth week through the fusion of five tissue extensions (a median forehead process, and two jaw prominences on either side) [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R1)]. In the sixth week starts the development of the olfactory placode as an ectodermal thickening of the median forehead process. This leads to the development of precursors of the nasal openings (so-called nasal pits), and to the development of a medial and lateral nasal prominence on either side. In the seventh week the medial prominences fuse together in the median plane creating the intermaxillary process, from which later the median nasal content and philtrum originate. The jaw prominences also fuse with the medial nasal prominences creating the nasal openings and connect with the lateral nasal ridges creating the lacrimal-nasal groove. The nasal prominences as precursors of the nasal openings deepen and fuse to a Saccus nasalis. After the development of the palate and nasal septum from the maxillary prominences and forehead process, the first cartilage complex as a support framework begins to develop in the seventh week. The ossification begins ultimately in the fifth month. In the third month mucosa permeates into the lateral nasal wall and begins the development of the nasal sinuses, which correspond to lateral protuberances of the nasal cavity [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R2)]. Pneumatisation of such occur at different time periods. Only the ethmoid cell system is developed at the time of birth. Dysfunction of facial development leads to craniofacial dysplasia, such as cleft lip and palate. \n### 1.2 Postnatal development of the nose and nasal sinuses\nKnowledge of postnatal development is based increasingly on modern imaging technology. Postnatally the viscerocranium grows faster then the neurocranium changing the pediatric facial profile leading up to the adult face [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R3)]. In addition, further changes in size and form take place based on gender differences [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R4)]. The intensified development of the midfacial area of the nose and maxilla is of special interest for orthodontic and rhinosurgical procedures in children. With this in mind, the cartilaginous septal wall is the dominating growth area [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R5)]. The perichondium of the septal cartilage is bound on the cranial border with the periosteum of the nasal bone. The lateral cartilages extend over the entire length of the nasal bones and fuse with the cartilaginous attachment of the frontal skull base. The lateral cartilage and the septal wall build together the septodorsal cartilage. The perpendicular plate develops from the ossification of the septal cartilage. The vomer bone is built from a thin sheet of bone and the vomer crest from the basal border of the cartilaginous septum [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R6)]. Studies on the growth rate of the nasal septum without the vomer bone have shown that the maximal rate is reached in newborns, then slowing down until stagnating at the age of twenty and above. The size of the cartilaginous part shows a rapid growth with a maximum at the age of two. The further growth of the entire septum is due to the development of the perpendicular plate with continued ossification of septal cartilage and septo-ethmoidal links [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R7)]. At the same time follows the growth of the nasal concha with a maximum during the first five years of life [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R8)]. \nAt the time of birth, the _ethmoid sinuses_ are present in 90% of cases [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R9)]. The ethmoidal air cells grow up to the age of seven, and have an average volume of 4.51 ml at the age of fifteen to sixteen. Orbital complications under the age of six, therefore, usually have their origin in the ethmoid sinuses. \nThe _maxillary sinus_ is also at birth paired like the ethmoid sinuses. At the age of two the maxillary sinus has a volume of 2 ml. Up to the age of nine a volume of 10 ml has been reported. At the age of fifteen the growth of the maxillary sinus, with a volume of approximately 14.8 ml, has reached an end [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R10)]. The largest growth tendency is after the age of twelve when the alveolar crest hast been reached. The floor of the maxillary sinus in adults is 4.5 mm deeper than the floor of the nasal cavity. The anatomic relationship of dentition to the maxillary sinus changes over the course of development. Odontogenic maxillary sinus infection with orbital complication is, therefore, more often caused by permanent teeth rather than deciduous teeth. \nThe _frontal sinus_ can be identified at birth and is separate from the ethmoid sinus; however, it starts to expand after birth up to the age of one. After the age of four the frontal sinus starts to pneumatize, and after the age of six 20–30% of children have a radiographic pneumatized frontal sinus. As a child (from birth up to the age of twelve) there is a growth spurt, so that at the age of twelve 85% of children have a pneumatized frontal sinus. Bone resorption, up to the age of 25, leads to the final size of the nasal sinuses [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R10)]. \nThe _sphenoid sinus_ is at birth present as a protuberance of the sphenoethmoidal recess. At the age of seven the sphenoid sinus starts growing in a dorsal direction reaching the sella turcica and goes into a growth spurt that ends at the age of fifteen [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R10)]. \n##  2 Characteristics of surgical anatomy of the nose and the paranasal sinuses in children\nAn operation in a pediatric nose can be an elective procedure or directly following a trauma. Unfortunately, the clinical evidence for the effects of such rhinosurgery are not sufficient. There are many aspects to keep in mind when performing rhinosurgical procedures in children.\nOne must not only take into account the narrow anatomical conditions, but also the position of the skull base, especially that of the anterior ethmoids which shift during growth in relation to the orbital lamina. The anterior border of the perpendicular plate slides in a caudal direction during growth and can not be used as a landmark during surgery to approximate the location of the anterior skull base [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R11)]. In addition, the poor healing of cartilage, which is essential for midfacial growth, plays an important role. Negative effects of septoplasty in children were already described in 1916 by Hayton. Even today care is warranted in the handling of nasal abnormalities. Animal studies on rabbits have shown that the dissection of the mucosa off the cartilage does not have an influence on the growth of the septum and nose; however, resection of parts of the nasal wall affect midfacial growth – depending on the extent of removal and resulting defect [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R12)]. A larger interruption of the anterior-posterior continuity causes a shortening of the maxilla and nasal bones, a smaller defect usually does not effect the growth length. \nThe limited healing capacity of the septal cartilage is presently the limiting factor for the effectiveness of surgical procedures and should be accounted for accordingly. The submucosal reimplantation of crashed as well as non-crashed cartilage in the reconstruction of septal defects neither re-establishes the normal growth pattern of the cartilaginous septum, nor its effects to the growth of the midface [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R11)]. Therefore, the aim of all rhinosurgical procedures in children must be to sustain the normal growth of the nasal skeleton by respecting and preserving the anatomical structures.\nThe age limit for a functional aesthetic rhinoplasty in children has dramatically changed over the past few decades. Mouth breathing with no-exertion is nowadays a surgical indication in children, since an operation at a later point in time for a traumatically dislocated septum would have a serious effect on the development of the nose and midface [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R13)]. Children with obligatory mouth breathing, due to nasal septum deviation, have in comparison to children with normal nasal breathing facial and dental abnormalities [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R14)]. Some authors actually prefer a septoplasty in young childhood and see no negative consequence later in adulthood [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R15)]. Nevertheless, it seems that a consensus in the scientific literature on the effects of rhinosurgical procedures in midfacial development in children is still lacking. The following is certain for the optimal timing for an operation on the pediatric nose: a procedure performed earlier increases the risk in septal development; and a later procedure increases the detrimental effect on midfacial development and mouth breathing [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R16)]. It often seems acceptable to follow a “wait and see” tactic until puberty is reached (Figure 1 [(Fig. 1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F1)). Patient consent should not only include clarification of the surgical operation, but also include information on the importance of medical supervision of the facial development up to the end of puberty. A proper photo documentation is extremely important.\n### Figure 1. a) 18-year-old female patient after nasal trauma in childhood at the age of five. b) Intraoperative finding of the cartilagenous septum with severe irregularities.\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/f58e1de2a64c/CTO-13-10-g-001.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/F1/)\n##  3 Congenital diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses\n_Deformities_ of the nose are multifaceted. Deformities in shape are depicted in e.g. the bifid nose with a mild to more severe median split of the nose, or the double nose (also known as proboscis) with a complete second formation. Cleft lip and palate also belong to the clefting congenital deformities, which can during growth influence the form of the nasal alar and later require a surgical correction. The therapy of such deformities is surgical and can be undertaken before school enrollment. Exceptions are the correction of double-sided cleft lip or cosmetically very complex findings. In such cases, a delay till after the maximal nasal growth phase (after the age of twelve) is wise. Deformities of the nasal sinuses are more rare and hardly have a clinical significance. Worthy of mention are the hypoplasia and aplasia cases, in which mostly the frontal sinus in 3–5% of all newborns is absent. Further worthy of mention, although based only on case reports, is the fact that illnesses of the nose and nasal sinuses can also begin prenatally and so must be classified as congenital. Among other things, rising sex hormone levels and an increased sensitivity to allergens that effect the nasal mucosa can trigger rhinitis and epistaxis [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R17)]. \nThe most common deformities will be described in the following text.\n### 3.1 Atresia of the nostrils and nasal atresia\nNasal atresia can be congenital or be due to trauma and severe infection. The congenital atresias are inhibition deformities and result from persistent epithelial dividing membranes, which are usually absorbed in the second trimester of the fetal period [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R18)]. Their occurrence is extremely rare. In the area of the nostrils such congenital atresias are very rare. In addition to the closure of the nasal entrance, the nasal opening to the lacrimal duct can also be occluded. A clue to this can be a dot of pus or an eczema due to the epiphora in the medial corner of the eye. The surgical therapy is in the recanalisation of the nasal entrance and follows the same criteria as the acquired stenosis of the nasal entrance. If possible, therapy should be delayed till after completion of nasal development. \n### 3.2 Nasal fistula\nAs with the cleft lip and palate, nasal fistulas as well as the intranasal and extranasal meningoceles belong to the group of non-closed fissures. Median nasal fistulas are with an incidence of 1:30,000 very rare deformities. They are usually isolated cases not associated with syndromes or other deformities. The median nasal fistula is considered a remainder of the median nasal cleft. The external opening of the subcutaneous fistula lies in the middle of the nasal dorsum. The end of which lies in the area of the glabella; however, it can also extend to beneath the nasal bone. Fluid can collect in the duct fistula creating a nasal cyst. Due to the fact that the duct is covered with squamous epithelium, there is a tendency for inflammation. In rare cases a septal abscess can develop [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R19)]. The therapy of choice is the complete extirpation, in which plastic-reconstructive measures can be done simultaneously or at a later time. The surgical removal poses difficulties only when the fistula continues beneath the nasal bone.\n### 3.3 Meningoencephaloceles \nNasal Meningoencephaloceles develop due to failure of the anterior neuropore to close in the third gestational week. One differentiates between the outer extranasal celes from the internal, intranasal (basal) celes. Extranasal celes appear as a distension in the root of the nose. Intranasal celes can be seen hanging in the nasal cavity and appear as nasal polyps [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R20)]. This can lead to a misdiagnosis and a nasal polyp removal operation, which can lead to serious complications (e.g. liquorrhea, meningitis). Even without a preceding operation “spontaneous liquorrhea” can actually happen spontaneously [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R21)]. Furthermore, the dura in the intranasal celes can cause the septum to seem inflated. The differential diagnosis would then be a septal hematoma or septal deviation. The frequency of nasal meningoencephaloceles corresponds to about one per 3,000–5,000 births. Since recurrent meningitis can often occur, it is recommended to resect the cele with a reconstructive duraplasty through a rhinological and/or neurosurgical approach [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R22)]. \n### 3.4 Choanal atresia\nThe most common deformity of the nose interiorly is the congenital choanal stenosis or complete atresia. The incidence of this deformity is one per 8.000 births. It can be single-sided or bilateral, membranous or ossified. The singe-sided deformity as well as the occurrence in females is five times for common. Due to a horizontal extension of the palatal process around the eighth gestational week, the oral cavity is separated from the nasal cavity and the primitive choanae are sealed. At this point there is a membrane behind the nasal cavity, which separates the nasal cavity from the epipharynx. Only after the absorption of this membrane does the secondary and definitive choana develop [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R22)].\nThe single-sided deformity can be endured for many years as long as the air supply of the other side is adequate, and is often recognized at a later time. A cardinal symptom is the single-sided discharge due to the blocked transport of secretions to the nasopharynx. If one occludes the other side, any form of breathing is not possible on the affected side. The identification of the atresia is done with the politzer balloon, exploration with fine catheters, or radiographic contrast imaging in the supine position. In children the differential diagnosis is mainly the exclusion of a foreign body. The surgical correction of the atresia plate should not be undertaken before school age, it should rather be done after the age of ten [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R23)]. \nThe bilateral choanal atresia behaves in a completely different manner. There must be an immediate surgical therapy. Due to the higher position of the larynx of a child, in comparison to that of an adult, it is possible for a small child to breathe at the same time as eating. This helps reduce the risk of an aspiration pneumonia until the reflex pattern of swallowing has been properly learned. As a consequence of this, newborns can not breathe through their mouth. The bilateral choanal atresia then leads to a life threatening condition. The diagnosis of the bilateral choanal atresia is relatively simple to make with the aid of a soft plastic catheter, which is placed in the nose and advanced into the pharynx. If breathing through the nose is not possible, then suckling is also not possible. This requires feeding through a stomach tube initially. After the first few weeks it can be expected that the infant has adjusted to breathing through the mouth. The most common surgical approach is the transnasal puncture of the closure and the safeguarding of the new opening with a plastic tube, which is fixated on the septum [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R24)]. The opening of an ossified stenosis can also be performed with a drill transnasally. If the opening is not splinted, a closure will again occur. As the child grows the catheter has to be changed and the size adapted. There are many other surgical methods in addition to the transnasal endoscopic method; however, none has been shown to be superior to the other [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R25)]. \n### 3.5 Deformities of the nasal septum\nStudies on human fetuses have shown that 25% of fetuses at five months have a deformity of the posterior septum. The most common localization was the interconnecting area of the cartilaginous septum with the vomer and perpendicular plate. This percentage increased to 37% by the time of birth [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R26)]. Teul et al. performed computed tomography imaging on 105 miscarriaged fetuses in the 12th to 40th week and found 14% of cases with a septal deviation of 34% from the vertical axis [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R27)]. A severe obstruction of nasal breathing due to a septal deviation or external deformity is an indication for surgical correction (Figure 1 [(Fig. 1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F1)). Recommendations against opened approaches are currently not known. It is often preferred to postpone the operation till after growth development, since the established methods of septorhinoplasty in adults do not necessarily apply to children. \n##  4 Physiology of the nose and paranasal sinuses in the pediatric development\nAs is typical in the adult, the function of the pediatric nose is the humidification, warming, and filtering of the air we breathe, as well as to defend against germs. The human airways go through an important change in infancy and preschool age with significant adjustments in airflow. Especially the airflow ratio of oral to nasal breathing decreases with increasing age. The nasal respiratory volume increases from 6.4% in a ten-day old infant to 40.3% in a five year old child when compared to an adult [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R28)]. Children are used to nasal breathing; therefore, nasal packing should not be used. The inspired air is controlled by the olfactory organ located above the roof of the nose. The sense of smell matures with age and the function correlates with the growth of the olfactory bulb [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R29)]. Specific nasal reflexes serve to protect the respiratory system as well as regulate the air. The nasal cavity serves as a resonating cavity and for the generation of consonants to assist in phonation [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R30)]. The function of the nasal sinuses is still an ongoing research topic. \nThe _nasal mucosa_ is the first point of contact of the body with inspired antigens and pathogens; therefore, crucial for the immune defense. The nasal epithelium is built up of ciliated columnar epithelium. Basal cells overly a basal lamina, differentiate into intermediary cells that in turn differentiate into epithelial cells on the epithelium surface. The upper epithelial layer consists mainly (up to 70%) of nonciliated and up to 20–50% of ciliated epithelial cells, as well as 5–15% of goblet cells (Figure 2 [(Fig. 2)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F2)). A 10–15 µm thick mucus layer covers the ciliated cells and fills the gaps in between the cilia. The ciliated cells are responsible for the mucociliary clearance, in which the transport of secretion is directed toward the choana. \n### Figure 2. Immunofluoroscence analysis for the tight junction protein claudin 7 on a histologic section of a healthy patient (left) and an eleven-year-old child with polyposis nasi (right).\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/420689c79b4a/CTO-13-10-g-002.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/F2/)\nThe surface epithelium in the nose has one of the most important immunological functions of the nasal mucosa: the _barrier function_. The barrier function of the epithelium is due to proteins, so called tight junctions that are located in the apical area of the lateral cell membrane. They are organized in dense protein bands that establish a tight contact between the cells. On the one hand, the tight junctions ensure a diffusion barrier to the paracellular space above the epithelium (=non-permeability of tissue). On the other hand, they regulate the free transport of membrane components with the preservation of cell polarity and the directional material transport (Figure 2 [(Fig. 2)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F2)) [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R31)], [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R32)]. In addition to the barrier function, the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa plays an important role in the immune defense. A considerable portion of the immunity is due to the synthesis of antibody immunoglobulins (Ig)-A and IgG in plasma cells (B-lymphocytes) of the nasal mucosa [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R33)]. Antibodies of IgG and IgA isotype are extremely cytotoxic and kill microorganisms on the mucosa surface. The killing of pathogens activates a network, the so called mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which is linked with the systemic immune system [[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R34)], [[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R35)].\nIn humans it is assumed that the lymphatic tissue under the term “Waldeyer’s ring” is equivalent to MALT or GALT (gut associated lymphoid tissue), and _NALT_ (_nasal associated lymphoid tissue_) [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R36)]. It is currently not known if NALT exists in primates. In a post mortem examination in children under two years of age that died from sudden infant death syndrome, it was shown that organized lymphatic tissue appeared in the area of the nasal concha that was structurally similar to peyer's patches [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R37)], [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R38)]. \nThe development of immune tolerance and the IgA dependant secretory immunity strongly fluctuate after birth in all bordering surfaces of the nose, bronchi, and intestine. A disturbed barrier function of the epithelium with increased permeabilty is the basis for the pathogenesis of many illnesses in the nasal mucosa, such as allergies and recurrent infections with microorganisms. The barrier function is dependant on the age of the patient, genetics; and the immunological network of cells, nerves and neuropeptides, and inflammatory substances. Many studies have shown that allergies begin with a late and deficient development of the IgA system [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R39)].\nExpression of SIgA in nasal secretion of healthy child varies in circadian pattern, SIgA mean value in healthy children is lower than those values measured in 10 healthy adults. Furthermore, the 24 hours concentration profile of SIgA is more stable in healthy adults [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R40)]. The circadian rhythm normally depends on activity in the suprachiasmatic nuclei that orchestrate sleep- wake cycles, cardiovascular activity, endocrinology, body temperature. Nasal cycle and mucociliary transport are also regulated by these processes in brain and vary age dependent. _In childhood there is an insufficient number of ciliate cells and mucus-producing cells so that mucociliary transport becomes insufficient. The periodic waxing and waning in turgidity of nasal mucosa are not alternate but synchronous on both sides in child_ [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R41)], [[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R42)].\n##  5 Specialities of rhinosurgery\n### 5.1 Pediatric septoplasty and rhinoplasty\nSurgery of the nasal septum in a child should be as conservative as possible and as extensive as necessary. The application of polydioxanone (PDS) sheets has been examined in the reconstruction of septal defects in adult rabbits [[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R43)]. It seemed that the PDS-sheets stimulated cartilage growth. The septal defects were filled with newly developed cartilage within 25 weeks. After the reimplantation of resected pieces of septal cartilage that was sutured to PDS, deviations and duplications were, as expected, observed significantly less. Although there has been much promise in the advances of tissue engineering, the results are not sufficient enough to have a routine implementation in the ENT-field. \nThe growth spurt of the nose in puberty reaches its maximum for girls at the age of eight to twelve, and for boys at the age of about thirteen. The steepest decline in the growth curve, the end of the nasofacial growth spurt, has been determined as 13.4 years for girls and 14.7 years for adolescent boys [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R13)]. Another study group has concluded, based on a meta-analysis, that a rhinoplasty can be performed without risk after the age of 16 in girls, and after the age of 17 in boys [[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R44)]. Vorwoerd et al. summarized in a report in 2010 several essential recommendations to surgical aspects of the developing nose [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R11)]. The most important are listed as follows:\n  * The mucosa of the nasal floor should not be lifted in order to prevent injury to the incisive nerve.\n  * Incisions in growth and support areas, especially in the (spheno-) ethmoidodorsal area, should be avoided.\n  * A posterior chondrotomy or dissection of the septal cartilage off of the perpendicular plate should be avoided, since this could influence the reinforcement and growth of the nasal septal wall.\n  * The septospinal ligament (connection of the cartilaginous septum with the premaxilla) should not be cut, since this fixates the septum in the midline.\n  * Postoperative instability of the supportive frame should be avoided by means of repositioning and fixation.\n  * Intraseptal collection of blood should be avoided.\n  * Alloplastic and biomaterials should, since lacking in growth capability, be avoided. Autologous cartilage should rather be used when possible.\n  * Osteotomies do not pose a threat to the developing nose, since bone fractures completely heal. Lastly, the basic principle applies: the more conservative, the better.\n\n\n### 5.2 Surgical intervention of the turbinates\nSurgical procedures on the inferior turbinates are recommended in children in extreme cases of nasal obstruction caused by secondary turbinate hypertrophy. The indication to a surgical intervention is based on the exclusion of a nasal septum deviation, adenoids, choanal atresia, and foreign bodies. The rhinitis medicamentosa and the stuffy nose syndrome in infants and small children must also be ruled out as a differential diagnosis [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R45)], [[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R46)] according to Scheithauer [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R47)]. It is assumed pathophysiologically that the nasal obstruction leads to a disturbed climatisation function of the nose with accompanied infections of the upper airways. It is further hypothesized that a disturbance in facial growth can result from the permanent breathing through the mouth [[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R48)]. \n_Surgical approaches for the reduction of nasal turbinates are till now neither for adults, nor for children standardized_. There is a lack of evidence based studies, especially in children, for the objective long-term results of different procedures on the reduction of nasal turbinates. Accepted methods for nasal turbinate reduction include _total turbinectomy, the inferior turbinoplasty, the submucous turbinoplasty, turbinate reduction by use of CO_ _2_ _and YAG lasers_ [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R47)]. \nThe magnitude of surgical intervention in children in nasal turbinate surgery is controversially discussed. Principally, the mild reduction of turbinate tissue is recommended in order to prevent postoperative growth defects as would be the case in radical septoplasty [[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R49)]. Other authors examined the _partial or total turbinectomy_ in children at an age of 9–15 and under 16. The one study reached a success rate of 68% without any occurring complications, such as bleeding, synechia, or smell disorders [[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R50)]. The other study reported a success rate of 91%. A scab formation or atrophic rhinitis was not reported postoperatively [[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R51)]. A further study showed an improvement in asthmatic discomfort in an observational period of 4–6 years in 27.3% of the children [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R52)]. Another study examined 20 children, younger than ten years of age, that had a total turbinectomy performed; 78.9% of the children were free of symptoms at one year, 14.5% improved in symptoms, and 6.6% had no changes. It came to a disturbance in wound healing in 6.6% of cases [[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R53)]. _Even after an observational period of 14 years there was no change in midface development_[[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R51)]. The efficacy of turbinoplasty was also examined in a study with 64 children. Weider and Sulzner published a study in 1998 stating a success rate of 89% after 94 months [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R54)]. According to Stoll, a submucous turbinoplasty is indicated when in addition to a mucosal thickening a spongious swelling of the os turbinate is present [[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R49)], [[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R55)], [[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R56)].\nProcedures involving lasers in pediatric turbinate surgery are still not well evaluated. In general, due to deeper penetration of the ND-YAG laser, it is not favored in children [[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R57)]; the CO2 laser can be used in the single-spot method in children in general anesthesia as a minimally invasive surgical option [[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R58)]. \n### 5.3 Surgery of nasal trauma\nDue to the gradual ossification of the nose of the newborn, the cartilaginous frame of a child is more susceptible to trauma, and an injury at a young age can have severe consequences later in age. Trauma of the nose in children is quite often. Most injuries of the nasal skeleton are neither diagnosed, nor treated, and can later lead to aesthetic and/or functional problems [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R13)], [[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R59)]. It is usually the case that a post-traumatic evaluation of a pediatric nose is difficult due to rapid swelling. This usually makes the re-evaluation necessary in a few days after the use of decongestant measures. In addition to the nose, the orbital rim, palate, and maxilla must be examined. The endonasal conditions should be evaluated with a rhinoscopy. Diagnostic modalities for a child include x-ray imaging and the ultrasound of the nose. Ultrasonic examination can properly visualize cartilaginous dislocations and fractures [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R60)], [[61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R61)]. \n#### 5.3.1 Repositioning of fractures of the nasal skeleton\nA fracture of the os nasale is the most common midface fracture in children. Due to the fact that the nasal bones are less developed and are still partially cartilaginous, bone fractures are less frequent than in adults. On occasion, an interruption can be seen in the sutura on the border of the nasal bones. This can usually be repositioned manually by applying external pressure. Acute nasal skeleton fractures in children are always treated in general anesthesia. The nasal dorsum is elevated, thereby straightening the nasal septum, and at the same time the nasal bones are manually reduced [[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R62)]. The elasticity of the septodorsal cartilage as well as its tendency to take on the initial form is of major importance for success. The therapy does not differ from that of an adult [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R63)]. However, since children are used to nasal breathing, nasal packing should not be used.\n#### 5.3.2 Injuries to the nasal septum\nFractures in cartilage do not heal well; therefore, cartilage growth after a septal cartilage fracture usually causes a septal deviation [[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R64)]. Predisposed fracture points are thin zones predominately in the central part of the perpendicular plate [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R11)]. Due to the more frequent occurrence of nasal trauma in childhood in comparison to adult age, it seems plausible that a large proportion of septal deformities in adults are a result of pediatric trauma, most of which are at the time of injury not examined by a pediatrician or otolaryngologist [[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R62)]. It is known today that the developing septodorsal cartilage of children is essential for the growth of the midface. Not only the growth of the nose, but also of the maxilla are inhibitied by an early childhood septal injury. The long term effects on midfacial development are more evident the younger the child is at the time of injury and when destruction to the nasal septum happens [[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R48)]. \n#### 5.3.3 Septal hematoma and abscess \nAs is the case in adults, a septal hematoma or abscess requires the immediate surgical intervention in order to prevent a destruction of the cartilage. In addition to the drainage, repositioning of mucosal sheets, and sufficient antibiotic coverage, resected defects should be patched with homologous cartilage in order to prevent a saddle nose deformity [[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R65)]. Support of the implanted material with fibrin glue or PDS-sheets is rational. The reconstruction of the septum in the acute setting seems to also have positive long term effects on growth, form, and function of the nose [[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R66)].\n#### 5.3.4 Hematoma of the nasal dorsum\nFractures of the lateral cartilage with injury to the terminal branch of the anterior ethmoid artery can cause hematoma of the nasal flank. This appears as a bulge in the lateral nasal wall on endoscopic view. The hematoma should be drained in this area. The dislocated lateral cartilage should be pushed onto the nasal bone with internal nasal packing. \n##  6 Inflammatory diseases of the pediatric nose and nasal sinuses\nIncluded in the terminology “inflammatory diseases of the nose and nasal sinuses” are a wide range of diseases, e.g. the viral rhinitis, the acute sinusitis, the common cold, the allergic rhinitis, and the chronic rhinosinusitis, all subsumed and classified. Specific etiologic factors, such as the formal pathogenesis and therapy of inflammatory diseases, are being scrutinized in comparison to adults in a critically evidence-based manner. This is often due to the insufficient understanding of the therapy of inflammatory diseases of the pediatric upper airway. The clinical manifestation of inflammatory diseases of the nose and nasal sinuses varies extensively in children in comparison to adults due to the anatomical conditions, growth, and immunological processes. \n### 6.1 Pediatric rhinosinusitis\nAnalogous to the definition of rhinosinusitis in adults, the rhinosinusitis in children is defined as an inflammatory illness of the nose and nasal sinuses [[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R67)]. Since the mucosa of the nasal sinuses is simultaneously diseased during a rhinitis, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred to sinusitis. The rhinosinusitis is defined based on certain clinical characteristics. Typical rhinosinusitis symptoms include: _midface pressure or pain, nasal secretion, nasal obstruction, hyposmia, and coughing_. In order to make the diagnosis at least two of the three symptoms must be present according to the current guidelines. Usually the nasal obstruction and the nasal secretion, either the anterior or posterior nasal drip, is included. The severity of disease can be determined based on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 0–10 cm graduation: Level – mild = VAS 0–3, Level – intermediate = VAS 3–7, Level – severe = VAS 7–10 [[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R67)]. \nThe differentiation between acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis is based on the time duration of clinical symptoms. An acute rhinosinusitis corresponds to a duration of clinical symptoms of less than 12 weeks, while the chronic sinusitis corresponds to a duration of symptoms of over 12 weeks [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)].\n#### 6.1.1 Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS)\nThe acute rhinosinusitis in children develops after a _viral infection of the upper airways, also referred to as the “common cold” in the literature_. It usually spontaneously heals within ten days without any medical therapy. In the European position paper of EPOS, Rhinosinusitis is defined as a sudden onset of two or more of the typical rhinosinusitis symptoms (nasal secretion, nasal obstruction, midface pain or pressure, hyposmia, and coughing) for less than 12 weeks a year [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)]. Symptom-free intervals are present between episodes. A postviral rhinosinusitis corresponds to an acute rhinosinsusitis – in which the symptoms have intensified after five days of onset, or in which the symptoms persist even after ten days. \nThe _clinical diagnosis of the acute rhinosinusitis_ in children poses a diagnostic challenge because the distinction to symptoms of other inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory system (e.g. to allergic rhinitis) is often not possible. The symptoms are often subtle and the history limited to observation and subjective assessment of the parents. The endoscopic examination is often not tolerated in young children. Therefore, the diagnosis must be made based on the history, observation, and chronologic findings. It could be shown in studies that purulent rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction suggest the diagnosis of an acute rhinosinusitis [[69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R69)], [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R70)]. _Typical symptoms of ARS in children include fever (50–60%), rhinorrhea (71–80%), cough (50–80%), and pain (29–33%)_ [[71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R71)]. In a study of 60 children (average age 5.7 years), the impact of the symptoms purulent rhinorrhea, facial pain, and nasal secretion were examined based on morphologic changes seen in MRI examinations. The children had the relevant symptoms six days before the examination. The results showed that approximately 60% of the children have a pathologic shadow in the sphenoid sinus, and 18% of cases in the frontal sinus. After two weeks, a clinical re-examination showed that 26% of the children had a significant reduction of symptoms [[72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R72)], [[73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R73)]. \nThe _acute bacterial rhinosinusitis_ arises, according to the current guidelines, when a viral infection of the upper respiratory airways persists for more than ten days, or when after initial symptom improvement - the complaints worsen [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)]. In a study of 112 children between the ages of six months and 35 months, 623 infections of the upper airways within a three-year period was observed. In the viral infections 8% became complicated due to a bacterial rhinosinusitis; 29% of these episodes marked an increase in level of symptom severity in the study. In the group of 6–11 month old infants and the group of over 24 month old children the frequency of rhinosinusitis was 7%, in the group of children between 12–23 months of age the frequency was 10% [[74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R74)]. In another study, the incidence of bacterial rhinosinusitis was determined as 4–7.3% [[75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R75)]. The incidence of children during the first year of life was set higher. Children under the age of five had on average of two to seven episodes a year. \nIncluded in the _differential diagnosis_ is the unilateral secretion of the nose, a foreign body in the nose, or a _unilateral choanal atresia_. The _acute adenoiditis_ imitates symptoms of the ARS. The adenoid size usually decreases with ongoing age [[76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R76)]. Adenoids are largest at the age of four to five. In a study with 287 children and typical ARS symptoms it was attempted to differentiate between adenoiditis and ARS. A nasal endoscopy was performed and the diagnosis was made based on the localization of purulent secretion. Purulent secretion in the ostiomeatal unit and in the ethmoidal area allocated the illness to the ARS group, while purulent secretion on the adenoids confirmed an adenoiditis. Rhinosinusitis was diagnosed in 89.2% of the patients, combined with adenoiditis in 19.2% of cases. An adenoiditis alone was only diagnosed in 7% of cases in the cohort. The combined form of inflammatory disease of the upper airways was more common in younger children at the age of two to five. The isolated rhinosinusitis was more frequent in older children [[77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R77)]. \nThe most common microorganisms that cause a _bacterial ARS_ are _Streptococcus pneumonia_ , _Hemophilus influenza_ , _Moraxella catarrhalis_ , Streptococcus pyogenes, and _anaerobes_ [[78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R78)]. Although in the period from 1998 to 2007, the rate of medical consultation in the USA due to middle ear infection considerably dropped, the frequency of medical visits due to ARS remained stable; 11–14 medical visits per 1,000 children has been published in the literature [[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R79)]. \nThe diagnostic evaluation includes the physical examination and detailed history taking as well as the _rhinoscopia anterior_ to assess the inferior nasal concha, the middle meatus, and the characteristics of the mucosa. The nasal endoscopy is also helpful in examining the adenoids and posterior nasal space; however, this can only be done when the child is at a certain age allowing the examination. Examination of the posterior wall of the pharynx also sheds light on postnasal secretions or cobblestone-changes to the mucosa. \n_A swab test is usually not necessary in an uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis_. A swab test is necessary when children do not respond to conventional medical therapy within 48–72 hours, or an immunodeficiency exists [[80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R80)]. The gold standard in making the diagnosis of bacterial ARS includes the swab test from aspirated secretion out of the maxillary sinus. Unfortunately, this method is too invasive for children. For this reason it is preferred to take a swab test from the middle meatus, since the results correlate well with those taken from the maxillary sinus (according to the literature). Although the diagnosis of ARS in children can be made based on clinical symptoms, the American Academy of Pediatrics published and recommends in their 2001 guidelines the computed tomography as the imaging of choice [[81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R81)]. _Computed tomographic imaging should, in this context, only be used on patients with persistent symptoms after 10 days of ongoing complaints with evidence of endocranial or orbital complications_. Magnetic resonance imaging of the nasal sinuses, orbita, and endocranium can always be done by suspicion of complications. \n_Antibiotics_ are the most common medication used in the therapeutic treatment of ARS. In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies three of 17 reports were evaluated dealing with antibiotic therapy in pediatric acute rhinosinusitis. A total of 3,291 cases (2,115 adults and 306 children) were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnosis of the acute rhinosinusitis was made based on clinical criteria, radiographic or other clinical laboratory test parameters. In most studies, patients were included with a duration of symptoms of at least 7–10 days. The results showed that in comparison to the placebo group, the antibiotic group had a higher rate of healing within 7–15 days. The difference was significant, but not very pronounced [[82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R82)]. In a further study, amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was examined in a group of children between the ages of one to ten with acute bacterial ARS in comparison to a placebo group. A score based on symptoms was made at different time points. The children were all evaluated on day 14 after the onset of therapy and classified as healed, improved, or worsened. Children that received antibiotics seemed to be in the healed category more often (50% versus 14%, P=0.01), and were less prone to having a therapy failure (14% versus 68%, P<0.01) in comparison to the placebo group. As shown in other studies, there were no side effects in comparison to the placebo group [[83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R83)], [[84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R84)]. A further study examined children at the age of 1–15, in which ARS had been diagnosed based on clinical and radiographic findings. The children received cefditoren (8–12 mg/kg per day), a third generation cephalosporine, versus amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid (80–90 mg/kg per day) for 14 days. The results showed similar but not statistically significant differences on day 14 [[85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R85)]. \nIn summary, the results of the existing studies show that most cases of _uncomplicated ARS heal independent of therapy_. An improvement in symptoms is seen by the use of antibiotics. Based on this fact, it can be inferred that antibiotic therapy is prudent in complicated episodes of ARS. _The antibiotic therapy is reserved for children with complications or associated disease, such as bronchial asthma and/or chronic bronchitis_ (Figure 3 [(Fig. 3)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F3)). In this context, the data shows that an antibiotic therapy accelerates the therapy of ARS. It must still be examined if antibiotic therapy increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. The therapy recommendation is then amoxicillin 40 mg/kg per day to 80 mg/kg per day. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and cephalosporine should be given when β-lactamase producing bacteria are found. In cases of hypersensitivity, the antibiotics trimethoprime, azithromycine, and clarythromycine can be used as substitutes [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)].\n##### Figure 3. Management of acute rhinosinusitis in childhood modified according to EPOS.\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/ac0a54f57c4b/CTO-13-10-g-003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4273171_CTO-13-10-g-003.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/F3/)\n##### Efficacy of nasal glucocorticosteroids in the therapy of ARS\n_The therapy of ARS with nasal steroids is currently considered favorable (evidence based) as a monotherapy in older children_ [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)]. However, studies are limited in pediatric ARS in comparison to adults. Barlan et al. studied 89 children with acute ARS receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid combined with budenoside versus placebo. Significant improvement could be shown in the scores for coughing and nasal secretion at the end of the second week in the therapy group [[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R86)]. Other studies with mixed populations, adults and children (usually 12–14 years of age), have shown similar results with the application of intranasal steroids in combination with antibiotics. In another randomized placebo controlled study, patients older than twelve were treated with mometasone versus placebo or amoxicillin. The symptoms were reduced more in the monotherapy as compared to the control group. There is no evidence for younger children due to the lack of studies [[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R87)], [[88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R88)], [[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R89)], [[90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R90)], [[91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R91)]. \n##### Other forms of therapy for the acute rhinosinusitis\nThe evidence of supportive therapy (such as the application of oral and nasal antihistamines, nasal douches, and β-adrenergic topical substances) were evaluated in a systematic Cochrane review. Out of 402 articles, 44 publications were included that fulfilled the requirements of a randomized control set-up. Based on these results, it is not possible to determine an evidence based therapy for ARS; therefore, the authors concluded that a supportive therapy does not offer any advantage [[92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R92)]. In a randomized placebo controlled study published in 2010 from Unuvar et al. the mucolytic substance erdosteine was examined versus placebo on 80 patients with an average age of 8.5 years. Both patient groups showed a vast improvement of the symptoms on day 14, and there was no significant difference between the two groups [[93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R93)]. A mucolytic therapy is, therefore, not recommended. \n#### 6.1.2 Complications of the acute rhinosinusitis\nComplications of ARS include orbital, intracranial, and osseous inflammatory changes – as in osteomyelitis. Historically, complications in ARS were witnessed more often in the pre-antibiotic era. Thanks to current diagnostic tools, such as CT and MRI imaging, the extent of complications in ARS are better recognized. Children are predisposed to orbital complications, whereas adults develop complications due to chronic rhinosinusitis. Orbital complications present in about 60–70% of cases, about double as often as intracranial complications (15–20%). ARS complications that affect the bones in the facial skull area present in 5–10% of cases [[94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R94)]. Although orbital complications usually appear in younger children, intracranial complications can occur at any age. It could also be shown in studies that a seasonal dependence with formation of complications in the winter months could be proven. In spite of antibiotic therapy, infections of the nasal sinuses can lead to complications when the infection is not completely healed [[95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R95)]. National epidemiologic studies estimate a complication rate for the acute rhinosinusitis of approximately three episodes per million inhabitants per year [[96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R96)], [[97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R97)], [[98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R98)], [[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R99)]. In comparison to adults, the orbital complication in children is often painless [[100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R100)]. In order to safely make the diagnosis of an orbital complication, an opthalmological examination is necessary in addition to the clinical findings. Imaging (CT) is recommended in cases of protrusio bulbi, double vision, and a conjunctival edema with chemosis.\n##### 6.1.2.1 Orbital complications in the acute rhinosinusitis \nThe classification of orbital complications is based on Chandler [[101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R101)]. The method of choice to secure the diagnosis is a low dose CT. Direct coronal slides can be generated by coronal reconstruction using a (multi-slice) spiral CT dataset. Orbital complications are classified according to Chandler as shown in Table 1 [(Tab. 1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#T1).\n###### Table 1. Classification of orbital complications (Chandler, 1970 [101]).\n![Table 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/31fec1a333ac/CTO-13-10-t-001.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/T1/)\nThe preseptal cellulitis (eyelid phlegmon) is from an anatomical standpoint not an intraorbital complication. Since the orbital septum is the anterior border anatomically to the orbit, the description should be that of an eyelid phlegmon rather than a preseptal cellulitis [[102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R102)], [[103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R103)]. From a clinical perspective, the preseptal phlegmon is distinguishable from other stages of orbital complication due to the lack of exopthalmus and painful eye movements with double vision [[104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R104)]. Imaging is often not necessary in such cases. Based on the clinical findings and the rather favorable prognosis in comparison to other stages of orbital complication, the therapy of choice for the eyelid phlegmon is an oral antibiotic [[94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R94)]. \nThe _periostitis of the lamina papyracea_ and _intraorbital phlegmon_ are often present as complications of an acute rhinosinusitis [[105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R105)], [[106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R106)]. The symptoms in children are characterized by an exopthalmus, a reduced and painful eye movement, and a reduction in vision (red-green color vision). In the differential diagnosis, one should rule out a subperiosteal abscess through appropriate imaging. The therapy consists of an intravenous antibiotic regiment. An opthalmological examination should also be performed. A subperiosteal abscess originates through the progression of the infection into the orbit. Pathophysiologically, the infection travels often through a dehiscent lamina papyracea into the orbit; on the other hand, a venous carry over of infectious thrombi has been discussed [[107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R107)], [[108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R108)]. The orbital abscess, usually located intraconally in the orbit, is formed due to a diagnostic delay or an immunosuppression. A CT is usually recommended to make the diagnosis. The predictive rate for the clinical diagnosis of an orbital abscess based on the examiner is 82%; the predictive rate based on computed tomography is 91%. An MRI can be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or suspected intracranial complication [[109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R109)]. The therapy of a subperiosteal abscess, diagnosed in a CT, requires mandatorily an intravenous antibiotic. If the symptoms do not improve within the first 24–48 hours then a surgical drainage of the abscess is obligatory. The surgical drainage of a subperiosteal abscess is done by endoscopically opening the ethmoidal cells. In extreme cases one can also use a transfacial approach to the lateral medial orbit [[110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R110)], [[111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R111)]. It has been shown, based on the evidence, that a conservative therapy regiment is beneficial in young children. A prerequisite for the conservative therapy is as follows [[109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R109)], [[112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R112)]:\n  * Improvement in symptoms within 24–48 hours\n  * No loss in vision\n  * Medially located subperiosteal abscess (volume less than 0.5–1 ml)\n  * No systemic signs of the desease\n  * Age of patient younger than 2–4 years\n\n\n##### 6.1.2.2 Endocranial complications of the acute rhinosinusitis\nIntracranial complication of a rhinosinusitis include the epidural, subdural and brain abscess, meningitis, cerebritis, cavernous sinus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The symptoms of intracranial complications are often non-specific, such as fever, headaches, lethargy, and difficulty in concentrating. On the other hand, focal neural dysfunction of the oculomotor, trigeminal and facial nerve as well as signs of an increased intracranial pressure have priority. Endocranial complications arise from a complicated rhinosinusitis in the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoid sinuses. The diagnostics are usually supplemented with a CT. The CT provides more information about the defects in the osseous structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is often used to rule out a cavernous sinus thrombosis, since an MRI is more sensitive in this area. Information on the mortality of endocranial complications in the pediatric population is rare. In a study from Broberger the mortality was cited as 10–20% [[112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R112)]. \n##### 6.1.2.3 Complications in osseous structures of the facial skeleton\nInfections in nasal sinus surgery can progress to the osseous structures of the facial skeleton. If for example an osteomyelitis is present, an extension of the infection can cause an intracranial complication. The most common osseous complications are the osteomyelitis of the maxillary and frontal sinuses, especially in childhood. Gallagher examined 125 patients with complicated ARS and found in 9% of cases an osteomyelitis [[113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R113)]. \n### 6.2 Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)\nThe chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex illness in childhood. It is often made with uncertainty, due to the overlapping of symptoms with other inflammatory diseases of the upper airways. A chronic rhinosinusitis is defined as the _inflammatory change in the nasal mucosa and nasal sinus mucosa, in which the corresponding symptoms persist for over 12 weeks_. The most common symptoms, according to the children or parents in the history taking, are the _chronic cold, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and postnasal drip_ [[114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R114)]. In the differential diagnosis, one must consider a chronic rhinosinusitis, infection of the airways due to hyperplasia of the adenoids, adenoiditis, or even a flare-up of allergic rhinitis. The overlapping of symptoms of different diseases of the upper airways complicates diagnostic evaluation. \nIn comparison to adults, there is currently no reliable epidemiological prevalence data on children with chronic rhinosinusitis. According to a present study, the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults based on self-diagnosis was around 7.5%. In 19 European centers the average prevalence was determined to be 11% [[115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R115)]. Studies in the pediatric population, which examined the incidence depending on the pathological findings _in computed tomography images, found in a study population of children without clinical symptoms of rhinosinusitis pathological mucosal changes in 18–45% of cases_ [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)], [[116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R116)], [[117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R117)]. It was determined that the Lund-McKay score was adequate in diagnosing a CRS in children. A Lund-Mckay score of 2.8 was calculated for a population of children without symptoms of rhinosinusitis, while a Lund-McKay score of 5.0 was calculated for the presence of chronic rhinosinusitis in children [[118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R118)], [[119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R119)]. \nOther studies examining the prevalence in a pediatric population, although not stating any information on incidence, determined the _age dependence in occurrence of CRS_ in the different nasal sinuses. A group of children (N=196) between the ages of three and fourteen were examined. In the youngest age group a maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed in 63% of cases, a sphenoid sinusitis in 29% of cases, and an ethmoid sinusitis in 58% of cases. In the age group of 13–14 year olds an incidence of 10% for the ethmoid sinusitis, 0% for the sphenoid sinus, and 65% for the maxillary sinus was determined [[120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R120)]. A risk factor to fall ill to chronic rhinosinusitis is age. In the group of two to six year olds the risk is 74%, and in the group of over ten years old is 38% [[121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R121)]. Another studies has also shown that the prevalence with increasing age (after 6–8 years) decreases [[122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R122)]. \n_Children with chronic rhinosinusitis suffer a restricted quality of life_. Children that have comorbidities (such as asthma, attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy) in addition to chronic rhinosinusitis are especially limited. An improvement in the quality of life could be shown after functional sinus surgery or the removal of adenoids [[123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R123)], [[124](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R124)], [[125](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R125)]. \n#### 6.2.1 Etiologic factors in CRS \n_It is still presently unclear to what extent the anatomical aberrations in the ostiomeatal complex have in the development of a chronic rhinosinusitis_. Although the presence of a concha bullosa, haller cell, and agger nasi cell was often diagnosed in children with chronic rhinosinusitis, the results were not compared to that of a control group. Changes to the nasal septum seem to play a minor role [[126](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R126)], [[127](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R127)]. \nThe _microbiological findings_ usually shows gram positive bacteria: _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , _Hemophilus influenza_ , and _Moraxella catharrhalis_. _Staphylococcus aureus_ , β-hemolytic streptococci as well as gram negative bacteria (bacteroides and fusobacterium) are also found in chronic rhinosinusitis [[128](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R128)], [[129](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R129)]. Although biofilms have been detected in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, studies detecting biofilms in the pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis are still being awaited. \nThe _pathophysiological role of the adenoids_ in the formation of chronic rhinosinusitis is based on the anatomical location near the nasal cavity. The adenoids comprise a _bacterial reservoir_ for the formation and sustenance of chronic rhinosinusitis in children. In an electron microscope study examining the adenoids in children with chronic rhinosinusitis, a biofilm formation could be shown in 88–99% of cases [[130](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R130)]. In comparison, adenoids removed from children with sleep apnea showed a biofilm formation in only 6% of cases [[131](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R131)]. It could also be shown that swab testing of the middle meatus and the adenoids in chronic rhinosinusitis had identical bacterial cultures. The bacterial cultures grown from the adenoids have a predictive value of 91.5% for the same culture in the middle meatus [[132](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R132)].\n#### 6.2.2 Factors of morbidity for chronic rhinosinusitis\nThe allergic rhinitis is also a factor of morbidity in the pediatric population. _Information about the association between both of these illnesses varies considerably. The association to allergy varies between 40–53%_ [[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R133)], [[134](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R134)]. Other authors could not find a correlation between radiographic findings in CT imaging and atopic status [[121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R121)], [[135](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R135)]. A study showed positive skin prick testing in 30% of children. The prevalence did not differ from allergies in the normal population [[136](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R136)] (32%). \n_Bronchial asthma_ also belongs to the illnesses that can be associated with chronic rhinosinusitis in childhood. In a study from Rachelefsky, 48 children with severe asthma and comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis were treated surgically and with asthma medication. 80% of the children could reduce their asthma medication after surgical therapy [[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R137)]. Another study could also prove the concept of local asthma control through the therapy of the Rhinosinusitis [[138](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R138)].\n_The association of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic rhinosinusitis in childhood has been proven in a multitude of studies_. It could be shown that 63% of children with chronic rhinosinusitis have gastroesophageal reflux (by means of 24-hour pH-metry testing) [[139](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R139)]. Of those children, 90% benefited from a drug therapy for gastroesophageal reflex [[140](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R140)]. Furthermore, it could be shown in a large case-controlled study that the diagnosis of sinusitis in children with GERD was significantly higher. 4.19% of children presented with a sinusitis in comparison to the control group (1.35%) [[141](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R141)].\n#### 6.2.3 Forms of chronic rhinosinusitis in childhood\nIn the last decade, phenotyping of CRS became more common in adults. Inflammation in sinuses can be divided in CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Diffuse bilateral nasal polyps are dominated by eosinophilic inflammation type, whereas CRSsNP mostly is dominated by neutrophilic type of inflammation [[142](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R142)]. Etiology of CRS is still a matter of debate, but colonization of _S. aureus_ in CRSwNP is linked to asthma [[143](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R143)], [[144](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R144)]. The allergic fungal sinusitis (AFRS) in contrast is associated with fungal disease. Formation of nasal polyps in cystic fibrosis is mostly generated by bacterial infection [[145](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R145)]. \nKnowledge on AFRS in child is rare and refers to knowledge on AFRS in adults. Fungal sinusitis is substantially graded in acute invasive, chronic indolent invasive forms as in fungus ball and allergic fungal sinusitis. AFRS displays one subtype of eosinophilc CRSwNP described by Bent et al. [[146](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R146)] and is diagnosed by means of:\n  * Type IgE-mediated sensitivity (history, skin tests, specific IgE in vitro)\n  * Nasal polyposis \n  * Eosinophilic mucin (Charcot-Leyden Crystals)\n  * Chronic changes on CT scan (ostitis; osseous erosion)\n  * Fungal hyphae in the tissue with signs of invasive disease\n\n\nThe diagnosis of AFRS refers in childhood to adolescents and young adults: the mean age at time of diagnosis is 21.9 years. The incidence of AFRS varies due to climatic factors [[147](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R147)], [[148](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R148)]. Marple reported that children described a protacted nasal obstruction with dark coloured secretion from the nose at the first stage of disease [[149](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R149)], [[150](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R150)], [[151](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R151)]. Characteristic findings in CT-scan are important for further therapy. 56% of the patients had an ostitis with osseus expansion und erosion of the sinuses. 70% of children with AFRS have unilateral findings whereas in adults unilateral AFRS was found in 37% of the cases [[147](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R147)], [[148](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R148)]. A recent study reported that children with CRSwNP or AFRS are vitamin D3 deficient, which may be linked to increased dendritic cell infiltrate in tissue. Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that orchestrates dendritic cells in a manner similar to corticosteroids [[152](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R152)], [[153](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R153)]. In contrast to these findings the number of eosinophils and lyphocytse are reduced in CRSsNP [[154](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R154)]. \n#### 6.2.4 Diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis\nIn the anterior rhinoscopy one should assess the middle meatus, the inferior nasal concha, the mucus secretion, and the form of the mucosa. The anterior as well as posterior rhinoscopy can be a challenge for the examiner in children. An indirect sign for posterior nasal secretion is purulent mucus discharge and cobblestone alteration on the posterior wall of the pharynx. If the children are non-compliant, the examiner is forced to rely on other findings. A skin prick test is often useful to rule out an allergic rhinitis. Recurrent infection, such as pneumonia and otitis media, can be an indication of chronic sinusitis. _The usefulness of performing a swab test to determine the bacterial spectrum is generally questionable_. Swab tests have a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 88.9%, a predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 85% [[155](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R155)], [[156](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R156)]. In comparison to that of adults, these results are much worse than the results of suction preparations, which show an extremely higher correlation [[155](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R155)]. \nThe computed tomography is currently the imaging of choice in the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis. In a prospective study with children with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, it could be shown that projection radiography in 75% of cases does not correlate with the CT findings. In patients with normal findings in conventional X-ray imaging of the nasal sinuses, 45% had a pathological finding in at least one nasal sinus in the computed tomography. Inversely, 35% of patients had a pathological finding in the projection radiography with a normal finding in the CT. In this respect, CT imaging is a more sensitive method than the conventional X-ray imaging of the nasal sinuses [[157](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R157)], [[158](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R158)]. In a further study, it could be shown that the assessment of the Lund-McKay score can differentiate between diseased and non-diseased children. A Lund-McKay score of over five has a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 85% in determining the proper diagnosis. A Lund-McKay score of less than two has a negative predictive value for the presence of chronic rhinosinusitis [[119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R119)]. _The indication for CT-imaging of the nasal sinuses is reserved for cases of chronic rhinosinusitis that have not been successfully treated with medication. Special cases of_ chronic sinusitis, such as the allergic fungal sinusitis and the cystic fibrosis, are shown well in CT imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for children with complications in the orbital area, neighboring skull base, and meninges.\n#### 6.2.5 Management of chronic rhinosinusitis\nA staged therapeutic concept is followed in CRS based on conservative and surgical methods (Figure 4 [(Fig. 4)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F4)). Both therapeutic methods have not been well examined in comparison to adults. The medical therapy includes antibiotics, use of glucocorticoids (topical and systemic), as well as the use of nasal irrigation. \n##### Figure 4. Management of chronic rhinosinusitis in childhood modified according to EPOS.\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/a0c0df7a26f3/CTO-13-10-g-004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4273171_CTO-13-10-g-004.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/F4/)\n##### 6.2.5.1 Antibiotic therapy \nThere is a total of four studies in the literature examining the effects of antibiotic therapy on CRS in children. Otten's studies from 1994 and 1988 showed no difference in the rate of healing in the therapy of a pediatric subpopulation with cefaclor verus placebo, and amoxicillin versus placebo. However, it must be noted that the description of the patient collective does not correspond to the present standard. The importance is thus greatly reduced [[159](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R159)], [[160](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R160)]. The literature also offers no evidence on the administration of short-term antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis in children. On the contrary, it is assumed that the use of a short-term antibiotic actually impairs the resistance. _The tendency is usually a long-term antibiotic as is usually the case in adults suffering from chronic Rhinosinusitis_ [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)]. \nAnother therapy approach is the intravenous antibiotic therapy as an alternative to endoscopic nasal sinus surgery. In a retrospective analysis of 70 children between the ages of 10 months and 15 years the symptoms completely subsided after the irrigation of the maxillary sinus and selective adenoidectomy [[161](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R161)]. A similar study retrospectively examined the effects of a four week intravenous antibiotic therapy after swab testing on 22 children (between the ages of 1.2–4.5) with chronic rhinosinusitis [[162](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R162)]. The symptoms also completely subsided in over 90% of cases. Therapy success was reportedly maintained for over 12 months. Unfortunately, both studies did not have a placebo controlled group so that _the intravenous antibiotic therapy can not be recommended. There is, up to date, no randomized control study examining the effects of intranasal glucocorticoids in children with chronic rhinosinusitis_. Nevertheless, _the topical glucocorticoid is the primary medication of choice in the therapy of pediatric CRS_. The use is based on the well examined efficacy of intranasal glucocorticoids in the therapy of adult CRS (level 1B), and the examined effectiveness and safety of intranasal glucocorticoids in the therapy of allergic rhinitis [[163](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R163)], [[164](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R164)], [[165](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R165)]. The _effect of a systemic steroids_ with methylprednisolone was examined in children eight years of age. Children received 30 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid and a tapered cortisone therapy. Based on the CT Lund-McKay score, an improvement was seen in the local finding as well as the symptom score. The results of this study with systemic steroids were considerably better than the long-term results after intravenous antibiotics [[166](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R166)]. \n##### 6.2.5.2 Additional forms of therapy\nNasal irrigation and decongestant nasal drops are employed in all patients with chronic rhinosinusitis in order to reduce the episodes of disease. Michel showed in a randomized prospective double-blinded study that with either an isotonic salt water solution, or with decongestant nasal drops, there was an improvement in the symptom score in children 2–6 years of age [[167](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R167)]. Wei examined in a further study the effects of treating pediatric rhinosinusitis with a salt water solution versus a salt water solution with added gentamycine locally for six weeks [[168](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R168)]. Both therapy groups were equipotent in the improvement in the quality of life. There exists no data on the therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists. These medications are reserved for children with allergic rhinitis [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R68)]. \n#### 6.2.6 Surgical therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis\nA surgical therapy for chronic CRS is necessary when a maximal drug therapy has not improved the symptoms. Interestingly, a maximal drug regiment similar to adults is not defined. Surgical therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis includes the adenoidectomy (AT) with and without irrigation of the maxillary sinus, balloon dilatation of the maxillary sinus, and the functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). \n##### 6.2.6.1 Significance of adenoidectomy with and without irrigation and balloon dilatation \nBased on the assumption that adenoids are a reservoir for bacteria, from which recurrent infections of the nose and nasal sinus originate, _the adenoidectomy is still defined as a cleansing procedure in rhinosinusitis. 69.3% of the children had benefit from adenoidectomy_ [[169](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R169)]. A current meta-analysis in a pediatric subpopulation with children younger than seven years of age and concurrent bronchial asthma showed no improvement of symptoms after adenoidectomy [[170](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R170)], [[171](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R171)]. However, the additional irrigation of the nasal sinuses in this pediatric population combined with the adenoidectomy showed a success rate of 88%. There is currently no evidence for the treatment with a long-term antibiotic after adenoidectomy [[172](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R172)]. The significance of the balloon dilatation is presently being arguably discussed; this is due to the fact that various studies examined the combination of methods: balloon dilatation, irrigation of the nasal sinuses, and adenoidectomy. The effects of each method could not be differentiated in these studies [[170](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R170)], [[171](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R171)]. \n##### 6.2.6.2 Functional endoscopic nasal sinus surgery\n_Nasal sinus surgery is considered nowadays as effective and safe in children. The rate of success is according to a meta-analysis 88% and has a low complication rate_ [[173](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R173)]. The functional nasal sinus surgery is effective in the alleviation of nasal obstruction due to polyps or concha bullosa. Improvement was determined to be 91% for nasal obstruction, 90% for rhinorrhea, 97% for headaches, 89% for hyposmia, and 96% for the chronic cold [[174](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R174)]. The assumption that midface growth was affected due to FESS could not be proven in long-term studies. However, in two other studies a recurrence of 39% was determined in children. Strikingly, these children had a CRS with nasal polyps and allergic rhinitis [[175](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R175)], [[176](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R176)], [[177](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R177)]. In summary, after failure of a conservative drug therapy in children with CRSsNP, the adenoidectomy with irrigation of the maxillary sinus (perhaps also balloon dilatation) is recommended. Children should have functional nasal sinus surgery when diseased with cystic fibrosis, nasal polyps, choanal polyps, or allergic fungal sinusitis. \n##  7 Systemic inflammatory diseases of nose and paranasal sinuses\n### 7.1 Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), or immotile cilia syndrome, is a rare inherited disorder with an autosomal recessive trait. The incidence is about 1:20,000–1:60,000 individuals. PCD is associated with a defective cilia of respiratory epithelium in lung, bronchi, nasal mucosa and middle ear, which clinically is characzerized by recurrent infections of upper and lower respiratory tract due to defective mucociliary clearance [[178](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R178)], [[179](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R179)]. The coexistence of PCD and situs inversus (SI) is called Kartagener’s syndrome (KS) and occurs in 40–50% of PCD patients.\nClinical severity of symptoms vary and it might account for up to 13% of all patients with bronchiectasis, The mean age at diagnosis of PCD , in a paediatric case series was 4.4 years (6 years for those without situs inversus) [[180](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R180)]. The assumption that KS clinically displays CRS with nasal polyps with duration of disease has not been confirmed in a longterm study with 30 children [[181](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R181)]. Organspecific manifestation of disease symptoms in ENT concerns 60% of paranasal sinuses and 78% of the middle ear [[179](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R179)], [[182](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R182)].\nEtiology of PCD is clarified by heterogenous group of autosomal inherited disorders. Defective expression of several proteins in ciliary ultrastructure accounts for PCD. Some ultrastructural defects are located dynein arms of cilia and are result of gene mutation of coding for proteins [[183](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R183)] (Table 2 [(Tab. 2)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#T2)). \n#### Table 2. Modificated list of most freuquent gene defects in PCD according to Barbato et al. [179]. \n[![Table 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/fb56be5e4b82/CTO-13-10-t-002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4273171_CTO-13-10-t-002.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/T2/)\nODA = outer dynein arm, IDA = inner dynein arm, KS = Kartagener’s Syndrom\n _Specific diagnostic work up for PCD is recommended for children with situs inversus, chronic cough, bronchiectasis and cerebral ventriculomegaly_ [[179](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R179)]. Diagnostic set up comprises serveral features such as examination of ciliary beat pattern and frequency analysis through high-resolution digital high-speed video (DHSV), immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy and genetic analysis (Figure 5 [(Fig. 5)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#F5)). \n#### Figure 5. a) Schematic structure of cilia in respiratory epithelium. b) Electron microscopy of a cilium (healthy and with ODA-defect). c) Immunofluoroscence analysis (healthy and with ODA-defect).\n[![Figure 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/39f6/4273171/0984d1b83a77/CTO-13-10-g-005.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4273171_CTO-13-10-g-005.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/figure/F5/)\nWith friendly permission of Prof. Dr. H. Omran, University of Münster\nTreatment of PCD involves antibiotic therapy of upper and lower airway infections for more than 3 months of duration. The most common bacteria responsible for recurrent infections are _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is recommended, whenever symptoms are not reduced by oral therapy [[184](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R184)]. There is no evidence for mucolytic therapy in PCD. Interestingly, middle ear effusions are not any more commonly treated by ventilations tubes because of prolonged follow up with otorrhoe according to guidelines [[179](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R179)], [[185](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R185)]. FESS is recommended at stage of complications or worsening of symptoms [[186](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R186)]. \n### 7.2 Mucoviscidosis (cystic fibrosis)\nThe mucoviscidosis is an autosomal recessive gene defect with a mutation of the transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CTFR) in epithelial cells, which regulate the chloride ion transport in exocrine glands. Clinical symptoms are associated with changes in the composition of secretions in the exocrine glands. As a consequence, an obstruction of the excretory duct with cystic-fibrotic transformation of the involved organs is seen. Mucoviscidosis is after hemochromatosis the most common congenital metabolic disorder in caucasians with an incidence of 1 to 2,000 newborns. Every year in Germany approximately 300 children are born with mucoviscidosis. The thick mucus in combination with a blockage of secretion transport due to dysfunctional cilia leads to recurrent sinusitis that is symptomatic in approximately 20% of cases. _Bilateral nasal polyps are most common in child with cystic fibrosis_. Results in a retrospective study from 1991 showed that 80% of children with cystic fibrosis had sinunasal polyps at the time of the operation. In comparison, only 16% of the children had nasal polyps diagnosed in the group with chronic rhinosinusitis without evidence of cystic fibrosis. A heterozygous mutation in the CTFR gene is with a mild form of cystic fibrosis associated, and can have a clinically normal sweat test. The rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis is clinically colonized by different bacterial subpopulations. In the cystic fibrosis group, 81% of the children showed _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ on the intraoperatively taken cultures [[187](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R187)]. In the course of an early colonization in the nasal sinuses with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , the bacteria acquires a phenotype that allows the survival in the lower airway tract [[188](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R188)], [[189](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R189)]. \nThe surgical therapy also plays an important role in addition to the conservative therapy with irrigation, mucolytics and topical corticoids.\nIn general, the results do not differ in the functional nasal surgery in children with cystic fibrosis in comparison to adults. Patients with cystic fibrosis tend to have pronounced nasal sinus findings in CT imaging, as well as heightened preoperative and postoperative endoscopy scores in comparison to non-cystic-fibrosis patients [[187](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R187)]. The postoperative results document the efficacy, safety, and subjective tolerance of the surgical procedure. Another marker that was evaluated in a further study was the health status, determined based on various in-patient stays. It was shown that there was no significant difference in hospital visits; an improvement in the quality of life was figured out. Associated with the improvement in quality of life was the reduction of nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, and postnasal drip, as well as a high satisfaction in functional nasal sinus surgery [[190](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R190)]. Interestingly, nasal sinus surgery in combination with antimicrobial irrigation was classified as significantly better than nasal sinus surgery without irrigation in an adult population [[191](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R191)]. This was determined based on a postoperative observational period taking into account the timing of a second and third operation. It can be said in summary though, that randomized controlled studies are still lacking in this area of nasal sinus surgery [[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R67)]. \n##  8 Distinctiveness of the allergic rhinitis (AR) in childhood\nThe allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-E mediated disease of the nasal mucosa. In the present classification it is divided into an intermittent and persistent symptom form. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis has constantly risen in the last 10 years; _about 40% of children_ and 10–30% of adults suffer nowadays from allergic rhinitis. In 15 years the prevalence is expected to reach 50% in Europe [[192](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R192)], [[193](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R193)], [[194](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R194)], [[195](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R195)], [[196](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R196)], [[197](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R197)], [[198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R198)]. \nThe AR is symptomatic starting at the age of four to five [[199](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R199)]. The prevalence at this age is around 5–9.6% and rises further in adolescence. The prevalence at the age of six to seven is noted at 7.2–8.5%. In a current study (“German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents”, KIGGS) the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 17% in the group of 13–14-year-olds [[198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R198)], [[200](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R200)].\nComorbidities in adult age are well noted; common comorbidities in childhood include bronchial asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, conjunctivitis, and otitis media, which can often lead to a clear limitation in the quality of life (Leynart, Weeinmaye, (prieto) Bertelson et al). It can be assumed that up to 50% of the pediatric patient population with AR also have or will develop bronchial asthma (AB) as disease continues (= change of disease level) [[201](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R201)], [[202](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R202)], [[203](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R203)], [[204](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R204)]. \nPathophysiologically, it can be seen that the immune response to inhaled allergens in the pediatric population is weaker than in comparison to adults. In an advanced stage of allergic rhinitis with symptoms of long duration there is a complex immune response on the molecular level. _This offers the opportunity to treat children in an initial phase of allergic rhinitis by intervening and influencing the natural progress of the disease_ [[205](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R205)]. \nThe specific immune therapy is still the only causal therapy form, and offers a therapeutic approach for the possibility of a modulation of the allergic immune response – also in childhood. According to the KIGGS-Study (“German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents”) 5% of children with AR and/or BA are treated with SIT (approx. 75% SCIT, 25% SLIT) [[198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R198)], [[200](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R200)]. The allergic rhinitis is the most common diagnosis in children treated with homeopathic methods. The subcutaneous immune therapy (SCIT) in childhood is according to the current S3-guidelines indicated under the following conditions [[206](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R206)]:\n  * Proof of an IgE-mediated sensitization based on skin prick testing or in-vitro diagnostics\n  * A clear connection of the proven sensitization with clinical symptoms and/or corresponding provocation tests\n  * Availability of standardized or high quality allergen extracts\n  * No possibility of adequate allergen avoidance\n  * Proof of effectiveness of the planed SCIT for each indication\n\n\nIn an actualized meta-analysis reviewed the effect of SCIT in the therapy of adults and adolescents. Five studies were analyzed that included not only adults, but also young patients with seasonal AR. It could be shown that there was a significant reduction in drug consumption and symptom score within the verum group in comparison to the placebo group [[207](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R207)], [[208](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R208)]. Other randomized and placebo-controlled studies have also established the clinical efficacy of SCIT in respiratory allergies in children. However, they do not reach the evidence grade 1A. Zielen et al. showed in a recent publication (a controlled study) that the SCIT with a house-dust-mite allergoid in asthmatic children with dust-mite allergy had a clinically relevant reduction of symptoms after two years of therapy. This was evident due to the significant improvement in asthma control and a consecutive reduction in inhaled glucocorticoids in comparison to the placebo group. There is presently no indication for the therapy of high grade asthma with SCIT [[207](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R207)], [[208](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R208)]. \nIn addition to the SCIT, over the past decade the efficacy of the _sublingual immune therapy (SLIT)_ has been examined. It could be shown in large randomized controlled studies of large pediatric collectives that the preseasonal administration of SLIT with grass pollen extract continued during the pollen season leads to a reduction of seasonal symptoms and drug usage [[198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R198)], [[209](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R209)]. Local reactions and light systemic reactions often do occur with the SLIT therapy; however, severe anaphylactic reactions or even deaths have not been reported in SLIT performed according to guideline standards [[210](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R210)]. Due to this, SLIT is being nowadays increasingly propagated as an alternative to SCIT in intermittent allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The indication criteria for SLIT do not differ from that of SCIT. However, one must bear the following in mind [[206](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R206)]:\n  * Use of SLIT in children and adolescents only with preparations of proven potency\n  * Age of patient should be over five for grass pollen allergies\n  * SLIT (as a less painful and, according to the current level of knowledge, less systemic side effect substitute) can be used as an alternative to SCIT in children, when the SCIT is not possible.\n\n\n_The follow-up of asthma symptoms in the SLIT in children with AR is controversially discussed in the literature_. A uniform therapeutic strategy could not be determined in a meta-analysis due to heterogenic measured parameters and differences in calculated score systems in the examined studies [[211](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R211)]. In another study from 2009, it could be shown that the asthma symptoms with SLIT were significantly reduced, while the rescue medication in comparison to the verum group did not change [[212](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R212)]. Studies comparing SLIT and SCIT do not presently exist.\nLong term observations of SCIT have shown a duration of therapeutic effect after SCIT of 12 years; however, the results of the studies are due to lacking randomization and placebo control only of limited usage. In the PAT study, a preventive effect in the level change could be shown [[213](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R213)], [[214](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R214)], [[215](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R215)]. The development of sensitization to other allergens could also be shown in studies [[215](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R215)]. Similar results could be shown in SLIT [[216](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R216)], [[217](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R217)]. \n_An early therapy with SIT may prevent the development of bronchial asthma and secondary_ sensitization to other allergens. _Therefore SIT is recommended in treatment of allergic rhinitis whenever possible._\n##  9 Primary immunodeficiency and antibody deficiency in CRS\nImmunodeficiency is often considered etiologically in children with recurrent infections of the upper airways, especially when the susceptibility to infection passes a certain level. A pathological susceptibility in children can up till now not be distinguished from a physiological susceptibility to infection. In a prospective cohort study on the frequency of airway infection conducted over a period of eleven years and 5,363 person-years in Tecumseh, Michigan, USA; the physiological susceptibility to infection was dependant on age. The frequency of infection was on average 4.9 per year for the ages of 0–4, for the ages of 5–19 was 2.8 per year, for the ages 20–39 was 2.2 per year, and for over 40 years of age was 1.6 per year [[218](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R218)]. The frequency of infection is further dependant on factors such as social structure, size of family, or the attendance of a day care center [[219](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R219)]. It is not possible to set an exact cut-off for a still normal number of episodes and a pathological frequency. The following approximate values (in small children) are valid: ≥ eight minor infections per year, ≥ two pneumonias or severe sinusitis per year [[220](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R220)].\n_A pathological susceptibility to infection can be a sign of primary immunodeficiency_. Primary immunodeficiencies are congenital dysfunctions of the immune system, which are according to the IUIS classification divided into 8 groups (International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification 2009). Primary immunodeficiencies belong to rare illnesses in which exact data to the prevalence, of the by now more than 170 different molecular genetic defects, is still lacking [[220](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R220)]. \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are associated most often with an IgA deficiency (30%), followed by an IgG subclass deficiency (20%), and a hypogammaglobulinemia (23%). Other deficiencies are more seldom, such as the combined B and T lymphocyte deficiency disorders (11%), phagocyte deficiency (8%), and complement factor deficiency (3%) [[221](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R221)]. \nThe _common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)_ is the most common symptomatic immunodeficiency in humans that leads to disease. The incidence in north America and Europe is 1:25000 and 1:6600, respectively [[222](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R222)]. The CVID is a disease characterized with a low serum immunoglobulin concentration, defective specific antibody production, and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Affected patients usually suffer from frequent respiratory airway infections accompanied with autoimmunocytopenia, lymphoproliferative syndrome, and granuloma [[223](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R223)].\nAccording to Bryant et al. [[224](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R224)] three subgroups can be identified: \n  * Group A: no secretion of IgM and IgG\n  * Group B: secretion of only IgM\n  * Group C: secretion of IgM and IgG\n\n\nThe _selective immunoglobulin-A-deficiency (IgAD)_ is characterized by low (<0.05 g/dl) or not detectable serum IgA levels in children under four years of age with normal IgG levels and an intact immune response. IgG-subclass deficiencies are characterized by normal serum levels of total IgG with decreased levels of one or more IgG subclasses. _IgG subclass deficiencies_ can be isolated or associated with other well-defined primary immunodeficiencies [[225](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R225)]. \nIn the patient subpopulation with diagnosed CVID, the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis is 36–78% [[222](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R222)], [[223](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R223)]. It is reported that 41% of cases have an acute recurrent rhinosinusitis and 40% of cases a chronic rhinosinusitis [[226](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R226)], [[227](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R227)]. A laboratory parameter, indicating an immunoglobulin deficiency, represents the humoral immune response to pneumococcal vaccine. Patients with a reduced antibody titer to pneumococcal vaccine suffer in 77% of cases on a rhinosinusitis [[227](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R227)]. \n_Diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency and antibody deficiency disorders is challenging and should be perfomed with peditricians_. Approximately 20% of the pediatric population have a IgG subclass deficiency without any clinically apparent symptoms. On the other hand, about 90% of children with IgA deficiencies are clinically symptomatic. The clinically assumed diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies in recurrent infections should be confirmed with pathological antibody titers. A so-called diagnostic delay has been described in the literature, in which a period of 4.7–15 years can pass between the first manifestation and final diagnosis [[222](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R222)], [[228](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R228)], [[229](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R229)]. A radiological examination with CT can also assist in the diagnosis. Between 53% and 90% of adult and pediatric patients with an agammaglobulinemia A or with CVID have radiographic signs of chronic sinusitis in CT imaging [[230](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R230)]. Shapiro discovered in a prospective study that in over 50% of two to thirteen year old children had a low IgG3 level and a poor humoral immune reponse to the pneumococal vaccine [[231](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R231)]. Another study examined the immune response of 27 children between the ages of 7 and 15 with chronic rhinosinusitis an isolated deficiency in IgA and a subclass deficiency for IgG2 and IgG3 was found [[232](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R232)]. Ramesh in a further study treated six patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, that had responded well to drug therapy, with intravenous immunoglobulin administration. The duration of therapy was one year. The success in therapy resulted in a decrease in drug usage and a reduction of rhinosinusitis episodes from nine to four per year; CT imaging also showed an improvement in local findings. _The authors concluded that children with chronic rhinosinusitis and an absent response to maximal drug therapy require investigation for a possible antibody deficiency syndrome_. \nAlthough an immunoglobulin therapy in severe forms of PID increases the total survival rate and lowers the number of life-threatening infections, it does not influence the degree of clinical CRS [[223](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#R223)]. It was shown that in CVID patients, even after intravenous therapy, 54–63% had a chronic rhinosinusitis. Swab exams also showed a positive bacterial or viral culture in spite of intravenous administration of immunoglobulin G. The therapeutic effect of an immunoglobulin therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis has not been proven. A summary of current treatment strategies is given in Table 3 [(Tab. 3)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273171/#T3). A surgical intervention in the therapy of primary immunodeficiencies has to date not been examined.\n### Table 3. Table 3 : Immunoglobulin therapy modification according to Hubert et al.

Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients.\n### Methods\n647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals.\n### Results\nThe prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) was 18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders, including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status.\n### Conclusion\nPD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.\n**Keywords:** Parkinson's Disease, Deep brain stimulation, Covid-19, SARS-CoV-19, Pandemic\n## Abstract\n### Objetivo\nLa COVID-19 ha afectado a toda la población, especialmente a aquellos con enfermedades crónicas, incluyendo a los pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson (EP). La COVID-19 puede empeorar tanto los signos motores como los síntomas neuropsiquiátricos de los pacientes con EP. El objetivo de este estudio es evaluar diferentes aspectos del impacto de la COVID-19 en los pacientes con EP.\n### Métodos\nA través de un cuestionario virtual se evaluó a 647 pacientes con EP de acuerdo con sus presentaciones clínicas relacionadas con la EP y con la COVID-19, además de la historia médica previa durante la pandemia. Se compararon con un grupo de controles sanos de la misma edad que constaba de 673 individuos y una muestra de la población general de 1.215 individuos.\n### Resultados\nLa prevalencia de la COVID-19 en pacientes con EP fue del 11,28%. La mortalidad fue del 1,23% entre los pacientes con EP. La prevalencia de COVID-19 en pacientes con EP con estimulación cerebral profunda fue del 18,18%. No se encontró una asociación significativa entre la duración de la enfermedad y la prevalencia de COVID-19. Se halló una prevalencia mayor de COVID-19 que fue estadísticamente significativa en pacientes con EP que tuvieron contacto directo con personas infectadas con SARS-CoV-2. No se encontró una asociación estadísticamente significativa entre el empeoramiento de los signos motores y la COVID-19. Los pacientes con EP y la población general podrían diferir en la prevalencia de algunos trastornos psicológicos, incluidos los trastornos de ansiedad y del sueño, y la COVID-19 podría afectar al estado psicológico.\n### Conclusión\nLos pacientes con EP posiblemente sigan protocolos preventivos más estrictos, lo que conduce a una menor prevalencia y gravedad de COVID-19 y de sus consecuencias en estos pacientes. Aunque parece que la COVID-19 no afecta los aspectos motores y psicológicos de la EP tanto como se esperaba, se recomienda la realización de evaluaciones más precisas para aclarar tales efectos.\n**Palabras clave:** Enfermedad de Parkinson, Estimulación cerebral profunda, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemia\n##  Introduction\nIn December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing a pneumonia-like illness known as Covid-19, emerged in China and spread quickly worldwide and is now an ongoing pandemic.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0100) The effect of the neurological disorder as a risk factor for Covid-19 infection is yet to be fully understood, and its impact on clinical features of these diseases needs to be well characterized.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0105)\nParkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, increasing prevalence by aging.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0110) As the PD occurrence is related to age and PD accompanies other comorbidities, it can be suggested that the risk of Covid-19 infection might be increased in PD patients.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0115) On the other hand, Covid-19 might also affect motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients.[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0120), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0125)\nIn this study, we evaluated the prevalence of Covid-19 in 647 PD patients along with other parameters, including mortality during the pandemic, Covid-19 symptoms, and alteration in PD motor and psychological symptoms.\n##  Methods\n### Study design and population\nThis cross-sectional, case-control study was approved by the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Researches (IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1398.439) to investigate Covid-19 prevalence and mortality rate, its clinical features, and further consequences in PD patients compared to the general population. In this study, 647 PD patients were included who were diagnosed by a neurologist based on the UK Brain Bank criteria and were being followed up at the Referral Movement Disorder Center at Shohada Tajrish tertiary hospital, Tehran. The patients with atypical parkinsonism syndrome were excluded from the study. A sub-group of 44 PD patients who had a Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery was also studied separately. The study was carried out in November 2020, when Iran was in the third peak of the coronavirus pandemic, and Tehran was locked down. Tehran was also locked down during both previous peaks, social distancing protocols were imperative, and all citizen had to wear masks in public places. After obtaining informed consent from all patients, a questionnaire prepared for the patients, consisting of demographic data, medical history, and detailed PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical information of the patients, was completed over the phone call. The same questionnaire was designed for the control groups and the normal population sample, which has been broadcasted over social media. The questionnaire was answered by 1366 individuals, and among those, 673 and 1215 individuals were selected as the age-matched control group and the sample of the normal population, respectively. The individuals for the normal population group were selected randomly from the general population to investigate the differences between them and PD patients in terms of Covid-19 and the current pandemic implications as their age, age-related lifestyle, and underlying diseases are different from PD patients. The normal population group is representing the features of the general population with heterogeneous composition. No identifiable data was not included in the questioner such as name, phone number, and national ID numbers, for the control group.\nThe diagnosis of Covid-19 was made based on positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 or ground glass appearance on Chest Computed tomography (CT) scan. The patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 due to clinical presentation of Covid-19 (i.e. fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, muscular pain, dizziness, and weakness), unusual and inexplicable symptoms, dropped O2 saturation, or prior contact with a Covid-19 patient went under either of these tests. A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, strong evidence of lung involvement on CT scan, or O2 saturation of below 94% were the hospitalization criteria.\n### Outcome\nThe study's primary outcomes are the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients, their mortality during the pandemic, and the effect of Covid-19 and the pandemic on motor and psychological status of PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 is studied in different sub-groups considering influenza vaccination, family history of neurological disorders, Duration of PD, and direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals. The PD and Covid-19 symptoms, in addition to the history of viral infections, are evaluated in this study. The history of visiting physicians during the pandemic is also considered.\n### Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis tests were as follows: Fisher Exact Text (for categorical variable), Mann–Whitney _U_ test (for continuous variables), and Anderson–Darling test (assessment of distribution). Statistical analysis was carried out via Excel Microsoft office, and R language (4.0.2 ed, 2020) implemented in R studio (1.3.1093 ed, 2020). The level of significance for all statistical analyses was fixed at 0.05.\n##  Results\n### PD patients’ demographic and general clinical features\nIn this study, we evaluated 647 PD patients (Mean age: 60.57 ± 12.46, Male: 410, Female: 237) for Covid-19 prevalence of their Covid-19- and PD-related presentations. The normal population includes 1215 individuals (Mean age: 39.84 ± 14.90), and the age-matched control group is composed of 673 individuals (Mean age: 56.32 ± 11.62). Tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity were the most frequent primary symptoms of PD patients, respectively. Duration of PD was about as following: (<1 year: 9.4%, 1–5 years: 37.09%, 5–10 years: 29.05%, >10 years: 24.11%) and we could not find any statistically significant association between duration of disease and prevalence of Covid-19 (_p_ -value > 0.05). During the pandemic, 71.87% of PD patients visited their physicians at hospitals or offices.\n### Mortality, Covid-19 prevalence, and hospitalization\nThe prevalence of the Covid-19 among 647 PD patients was 11.28%, and it was significantly lower (_p_ -value < 0.05) than the normal population (15.39%). However, the difference of Covid-19 prevalence between PD patients and the control group (14.85%) was not statistically significant (_p_ -value ≈ 0.0605) ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#tbl0005) ). The mortality rate of PD patients was 1.23% (stroke: 1, cardiac arrest without a definite diagnosis: 2, car accident: 1, gastrointestinal bleeding: 1, Unknown: 3) ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#tbl0010) ). Ten PD patients (1.54%) were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19, while this rate was about 5.76% for the normal population and the difference between these hospitalization rates was statistically significant (_p_ -value < 0.05). On the other hand, eighteen individuals (2.67%) in the control group were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19, and the hospitalization rate of this group was not significantly different from that of PD patients (_p_ -value > 0.05).\n#### Table 1.\nDemographic information, Covid-19 prevalence and two most frequent underlying diseases of Parkinson's desease and control group.\nDemographics and covid-19 prevalence | Mean age ± SD | Median age (min, max) | Mean duration of PD | Male:female | Covid-19 prevalence  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPD | 60.57 ± 12.46 | 62 (17, 92) | 7.67 ± 6.04 | 410:237 | 11.28%  \nDBS | 56.13 ± 8.72 | 57 (34, 70) | 14.52 ± 6.68 | 25:19 | 18.18%  \nNormal | 39.84 ± 14.90 | 36 (3, 93) | N/A | 455:760 | 15.39%  \nControl | 56.32 ± 11.62 | 55 (40, 93) | N/A | 280:393 | 14.85%  \nUnderlying diseases (2 most frequent)  \n---  \nPD | Hypertension (25.19%) and diabetes (17.15%)  \nControl | Hypertension (26.44%) and diabetes (14.26%)  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/table/tbl0005/)\nDBS: deep brain stimulation: N/A: not applicable; PD: Parkinson's desease; SD: standard deviation.\n#### Table 2.\nMortality cases among Parkinson's desease group.\n# | Sex | Age | Duration of PD | Underlying disease | Family history | Cause of death  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | Male | 79 | 12 | DM | Positive | Unknown  \n2 | Male | 81 | 8 | Seizure | Negative | Stroke  \n3 | Male | 61 | 16 | BPH, DM | Negative | Unknown  \n4 | Female | 75 | 1 | – | Negative | Accident  \n5 | Female | 70 | 15 | Hypertension | Negative | GI bleeding  \n6 | Male | 68 | 12 | DM, depression | Negative | Cardiac arrest  \n7 | Female | 57 | 7 | – | Negative | Unknown  \n8 | Female | 53 | 15 | – | Negative | Cardiac arrest  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/table/tbl0010/)\nBPH: benign prostatic hyperplasia, DM: diabetes mellitus, GI: gastrointestinal; PD: Parkinson's desease.\n### Past medical history of PD patients\nIn our study, 272 PD patients had a family history of neurological disorders, which the four most frequent of them was a family history of PD in 156 patients, a family history of Alzheimer Disease (AD) in 71 patients, a family history of migraine in 64 patients, and a family history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 34 patients. No significant relation was found between having a family history of PD, MS, and migraine and higher/lower prevalence of Covid-19; However, interestingly, it has been found that such a relation existed between the family history of Alzheimer and a higher prevalence of Covid-19 (_p_ -value < 0.05).\nDuring the last season, 32 of 647 PD patients got an influenza vaccine. No significant difference has been found in the Covid-19 prevalence, neither between PD patients who got an influenza vaccine and PD who did not (_p_ -value > 0.7) nor between PD patients and normal population who got an influenza vaccine (_p_ -value > 0.4). In addition, there was no significant difference between the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients and the control group who both got influenza vaccine. Moreover, the normal population and the control group were vaccinated for influenza more than PD patients (_p_ -value < 0.05 and _p_ -value < 0.01, respectively).\n### Covid-19 history\nMyalgia (45.30%), fever (41.09%), fatigue and weakness (39.72%), cough (35.61%), headache (23.28%), dyspnea (21.91%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (17.80%), sore throat (13.69%) and anosmia (12.32%) were most frequent symptoms of Covid-19 in the PD patients, respectively; while the most frequent symptoms of Covid-19 in the normal population were fever (55.08%), fatigue and weakness (55.08%), myalgia (54.01%), cough (45.98%), headache (43.85%), anosmia (42.78%), loss of appetite (35.82%) and sore throat (35.29%); respectively. PD patients reported a significantly lower occurrence of viral infections before the Covid-19 pandemic in comparison to the normal population (_p_ -value < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the occurrence of viral infections before the Covid-19 pandemic in PD patients and the control group (_p_ -value > 0.1). We found a statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19-infected individuals (72.06%) and that of the normal population with a similar condition (_p_ -value < 0.05). However, there was not a significant difference between the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19-infected individuals and that of the control group with a similar condition (63%) (_p_ -value > 0.1).\n### PD motor symptoms\nWorsening of motor symptoms was reported by 32.92% of PD patients, and this rate was 41.09% in PD patients who were infected with Covid-19. No statistically significant difference was found between PD patients who had Covid-19 and PD patients who did not (_p_ -value > 0.1) in terms of worsening of motor symptoms. Moreover, no significant association between the prevalence of worsening of motor symptoms and the rate of visiting physicians was observed (_p_ -value > 0.9).\n### Psychological evaluations\nDuring the pandemic, 43% and 41.09% of all PD patients and PD patients who had Covid-19, respectively, reported deterioration in their psychological status such as occurrence or worsening of depression. No statistically significant difference has been found in the rate of deterioration in psychological status between PD patients who had and had not Covid-19 (_p_ -value > 0.7). Such difference was not also statistically significant between Covid-19-infected PD patients and Covid-19-infected normal population or Covid-19-infected control group (_p_ -value > 0.4 and _p_ -value = 1 respectively). There was a statistically significant difference between the rate of deterioration in psychological status between all PD patients and the normal population and also all PD patients and the control group (_p_ -value < 0.01 and _p_ -value < 0.01 respectively), and this rate was higher in the PD patients in both comparisons. Moreover, this rate was significantly higher in PD patients who did not have Covid-19 in comparison to this rate in not infected individuals in the normal population (_p_ -value < 0.01).\nExperiencing anxiety during the pandemic was declared by 46.21% of all PD patients and 52.05% of PD patients who had Covid-19. The prevalence of anxiety was significantly lower in PD patients than the normal population (_p_ -value < 0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant difference was present between the rate of anxiety in all PD patients and in the control group (_p_ -value < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of anxiety between PD patients who had Covid-19 and PD patients who did not have Covid-19 (_p_ -value > 0.05). Moreover, the prevalence of anxiety in PD patients who had Covid-19 and the normal population who had Covid-19 was not significantly different (_p_ -value > 0.5). On the other hand, the difference between the prevalence of anxiety in PD patients who had Covid-19 and the control group who had Covid-19 was not statistically significant (_p_ -value > 0.5). In addition, no association was observed between the hospitalization of PD patients subsequent to Covid-19 and the prevalence of anxiety in these patients (_p_ -value > 0.5).\nExperiencing sleeping problems during the pandemic was reported by 18.54% of all PD patients and 26.02% of PD patients who had Covid-19. Both the normal population and SARS-CoV-2-infected portion of the normal population demonstrated significantly higher rates of sleeping problems than all PD patients and PD patients who had Covid-19, respectively (_p_ -value < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the rate of sleeping problems in PD patients and the control group (_p_ -value > 0.08), and also, there was no such difference between PD patients who had Covid-19 and the control group who had Covid-19 (_p_ -value > 0.1). However, the rate of sleeping problems had no significant association with neither rate of hospitalization nor prevalence of Covid-19 (_p_ -value > 0.1).\n### Patients with DBS device\nIn the current study, 44 of 647 PD patients underwent DBS surgery, and 8 of them (18.18%) got infected with SARS-CoV-19; there was no significant difference between the prevalence of Covid-19 in these patients with either the rest of PD patients or the normal population. Worsening of motor symptoms occurred in 38.65% of PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery. No statistically significant difference was found in worsening of motor symptoms between PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery and PD patients who had not (_p_ -value > 0.4).\n##  Discussion\nCovid-19 and its complications in patients with underlying diseases were among the very first concerns at the beginning of the current pandemic. The likelihood of a poor outcome in patients with PD after Covid-19 is hypothesized to be greater than the general population.[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0125)\nIn our study, the prevalence of Covid-19 among PD patients was 11.28%, lower than that of the normal population and age-matched control group (statistically significant and insignificant, respectively). Moreover, the mortality rate of PD patients during our study was 1.23%. Different studies have been published concerning the prevalence of Covid-19 and its mortality in PD patients; however, there is no consensus on the results. Some studies have stated the higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0130); whereas, other studies have reported a similar[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0135) or lower[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0140) prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients in comparison with the control group. The Covid-19 mortality rate of PD patients is also varied from 0.13% to 75% among different studies,[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0130), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0140), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0145), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0150) similar to or significantly greater or lower than that of the general population.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0130), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0135), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0140), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0145) The difference between studies’ methodologies,[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0135) condition of the health system in different countries,[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0100) ethnicity of patients,[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0100) and the timing of seeking medical attention[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0155) are possible factors affecting the difference between the results. In our study, the lower prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients in comparison with the normal population might be due to the tighter preventive protocols that PD patients follow because of their underlying diseases or advanced ages. This suggestion can be strengthened by our result that the prevalence of other viral infections in PD patients before the pandemic was lower than the normal population. In a study in line with our observation, it has been reported that the PD patients infected with Covid-19 were younger, and it may be due to the lower preventive measures of young people.[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0160) Moreover, it has been suggested that the similarity between PD patients and the general population's Covid-19 prevalence may be due to higher levels of attention, percussion, and self-isolation among these patients.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0130) The current condition of the health system in Iran, and the difference between the ethnicity of Iranian patients and the patients with other nationalities, might be other factors that participated in such an outcome and its difference from other reports.\nOn the other hand, the tight preventive measures in PD patients might mask the true vulnerability of PD patients to Covid-19 when the prevalence of Covid-19 is considered as an indicator. In this sense, PD patients might be more susceptible to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or having more serious Covid-19 complications due to the primary dysfunction of the systems (e.g., respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems) targeted later by SARS-CoV-2. PD leads to respiratory dysfunction,[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0145) gastrointestinal problems,[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0150) sedentary lifestyle,[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0115), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0165) immune system malfunction,[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0165) nervous system dysfunction,[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0115), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0165) institutionalization,[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0170) and a need for using medications with possible side effects and drug interactions,[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0175) which may place PD patients at higher risks of mortality and morbidity subsequent to Covid-19 infection. However, the effect of anti-PD drugs was found to be insignificant on the prevalence of Covid-19.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0175) In contrast, sudden discontinuation of anti-parkinsonian drugs is recognized as a potential cause of death in PD patients infected with Covid-19.[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0165), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0180) Advanced age of PD patients and long disease duration would be other risk factors for vulnerability to Covid-19.[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0135)\nConcurrent underlying diseases might also play an important role. Cardiovascular diseases are suggested as possible risk factors in worse outcomes in PD patients affected with Covid-19.[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0185) Dementia, hypertension, and PD duration may be other contributing factors for such outcomes.[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0145) Our results can be interpreted as the consequences of the pathophysiology of PD or its medications, as we have observed that PD patients who had first-degree relatives infected with Covid-19 possessed a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in comparison with the same group in the normal population. This result indicates that possibly PD patients are at a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19. Moreover, we have observed that DBS surgery might not put PD patients at higher risk of Covid-19. Although it has been reported previously that patients with DBS device are more vulnerable to Covid-19 poor outcomes,[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0180) similar to our results, Sainz-Amo et al. have reported DBS surgery would not affect the susceptibility of PD patients to Covid-19.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0170)\nWe found that although PD patients were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19 more than our normal population, the rate of hospitalization among these patients was not significantly different from our control group. This may indicate that other causes are involved in increasing the rate of hospitalization rather than PD. Our observation is in line with a paper from Vignatelli et al., which states that “PD per se probably is not a risk factor for Covid-19 hospitalization”.[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0190)\nIn our study, 32.92%, 38.65%, and 41.09% of PD patients, PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery, and PD patients who had Covid-19 reported worsening of motor symptoms. However, we could not find any significant association between Covid-19 and worsening of motor symptoms or between DBS surgery and worsening of motor symptoms. Similarly, it has been reported that motor symptoms did not worsen in PD patients during the lockdown period.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0130) On the other hand, in another study, it is reported that more than half of the patients experienced worsening of the symptoms, which were as the following: bradykinesia 47.7%, rigidity 40.7%, gait disturbances 34.5%, tremor 20.8%.[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0140)\nMoreover, we could not find any association between the deterioration in psychological status and Covid-19 in PD patients. However, these problems have been reported before.[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0140) Such association could not also be found between anxiety and Covid-19 and sleeping disorders and Covid-19. But interestingly, the normal population demonstrated higher levels of deterioration in psychological status, anxiety, and sleeping disorders than PD patients. Since our normal population was significantly younger than the population of PD patients, it is possible to interpret these results as a reflection of higher levels of psychological tensions that younger people encounter. This interpretation can be strengthened with the observation that PD patients had significantly higher levels of deterioration in psychological status and anxiety than the control group with similar mean age, indicating the age and its related psychological issues an essential factor. Therefore, it can be said the PD patients may have higher levels of deterioration in psychological status and anxiety than the control group, but these two are not as high as they are in the normal population because of possibly more psychological tensions.\nThe observations regarding the motor or psychological status of PD patients can be interpreted in the context of the current condition as it imposes limitations on the normal lifestyle, which may lead to deterioration in the clinical course of PD. Reduction in physical activity during quarantine may worsen both motor and non-motor symptoms as exercise may attenuate clinical symptom progression in PD.[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0185) Availability of PD medications, health services, and physicians’ advice or guidance during the lockdowns is recognized as an important factor in the deterioration of the clinical course of PD patients. In this sense, disability in PD patients may increase due to a lack of access to suitable and sufficient medications. This condition may lead to an increase in motor, non-motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and possibly higher mortality.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0175), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326006/#bib0180)\nSince some PD patients could not be reached because they may have passed away or hospitalized in other facilities, the prevalence of Covid-19 and the rate of mortality might be slightly different compared to the condition that these points are taken into account. Another limitation of our study would be the inaccuracy of our control group in terms of gender and age distribution despite of similar mean age.\n##  Conclusion\nPD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols since the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients, and the prevalence of other viral infections before the pandemic in these patients, and the hospitalization rate were lower than the normal population and age-matched control group. The DBS surgery did not have an association with a higher prevalence of Covid-19. Worsening of motor symptoms and deterioration of psychological status occur in PD patients; however, they do not have an association with Covid-19.\n##  Authors’ contributions\nConceptualization and study design: MS, ST.\nData collecting: MS, ME, PF.\nStatistical Analysis: ST.\nLiterature Review: ST, ZA.\nWriting Manuscript: ST, ZA, ING.\nEditing: MS, ST.\nSupervision: MS, AZ, ST.\n##  Data availability\nAll data will be available by the corresponding author on a request.\n##  Ethical statement\n  * -\nThis cross-sectional, case–control study was approved by the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Researches (IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1398.439).\n  * -\nAn informed consent is obtained from all patient for using their medical information.\n  * -\nWe confirm that we have read the Journal's position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this work is consistent with those guidelines.\n\n\n##  Financial disclosure\nNone of the authors have received any funding of any kind for either this project or other projects.\n##  Conflicts of interest\nAuthors declare no conflicts of interest.\n##  Acknowledgement\nThis article is taken from disease registry, titled “Parkinson's Disease Registry in Patients Referred to Neurology Clinics of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran (SBMU-PDR)” and code number “IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1398.439” from ethic committee that was supported by deputy of research and technology in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences ([http://dregistry.sbmu.ac.ir](http://dregistry.sbmu.ac.ir/)).\n##  References\n  * 1.Papa S.M., Brundin P., Fung V.S., Kang U.J., Burn D.J., Colosimo C.

While the detection of airway narrowing relies on the patient's cooperation performing forced spirometry, body plethysmographic measurements of airway resistance are less depending on the patient's cooperation and do not alter the respiratory tract by maximal maneuvers. Hence we compared both methods concerning their clinical value and correlation during MCH challenges in patients with asthma.\n### Materials and Methods\nCumulative MCH challenges test, consisting of up to 5 steps, evaluated with body plethysmography on each step were performed in 155 patients with bronchial asthma. Airway responses were recorded at each step of MCH application (Master-Screen Body, Cardinal Health, Höchberg). At the baseline test and after crossing the provocation dose (PD) threshold in body plethysmography (PD+100 sReff), forced expirations were performed and FEV1, FVC, and FEV1 %FVC were measured. Using regression analysis of the airway parameters and taking the MCH dose as the covariate, we could extrapolate to missing spirometric values and interpolate the estimated MCH dose when crossing the PD threshold (PD-20 FEV1) between two consecutive measurements. The administered PD+100 MCH doses for specific airway resistance, sRtot, and sReff were compared with resistance parameters Rtot and Reff, and to PD-20 of FEV1 and FEV1 %FVC.\n### Results\nRegarding sReff we found a mild, moderate, or severe AHR in 114 patients (75%), but only 50 (32%) according to FEV1. A statistical analysis showed strongly linear correlated parameters of airway resistance, but no significant correlation between the results of body plethysmography and forced spirometry\n### Conclusions\nUsing MCH challenges, we found specific airway resistance to be the most sensitive parameter to detect AHR. Raw is largely independent of height and gender facilitating the interpretation of measurements carried out longitudinally.\n**Keywords:** bronchial challenge, methacholine, forced spirometry, asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness\n##  Introduction\nAirway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is defined as an excessive response to an aerosolized drug provocation that elicits little or no response in a normal person. This feature, at some point in time, appears to distinguish most patients with asthma, and underlies the rationale for bronchoprovocation testing [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B1)-[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B3)]. Bronchial challenge tests by inhalation of aerosolized methacholine (MCH) are recommended by both the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B4)] and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B5)]. Differences in the reaction on provocative concentrations or provocative doses of methacholine causing a fall in FEV1 by 20% and/or an increase in sRaw by 100% derived by the dosimeter method or the tidal breathing method are still in intensive discussion [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B6)-[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B8)]. Currently, a 1-concentration 4-step dosimeter protocol for MCH testing was developed [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B9)]. The procedure was compared to the ATS standard protocol of five different concentrations [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B4)] modified from the standard procedures of Chai et al [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B10)] and Ryan et al [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B11)].\nDetection of airway narrowing in Anglo-American countries commonly relies on forced spirometry (FEV1). A fall in FEV1 ≥20% following MCH inhalation is widely used to determine the degree of AHR. FEV1, however, is largely depending on the subject's cooperation, his compliance, and motivation. In addition inspiration to TLC and forced expiratory maneuvers widen the airway caliber and thus lower respiratory airflow flow resistance [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B12)]. This effect was already described by Nadel and Tierney in 1961 [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B13)]. Slas et al [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B14)] showed that airways inflammation plays an essential role in responses to deep inhalations in healthy subjects and patients with bronchial asthma causing bronchodilatation. Bronchidilatation by deep inhalation may however be of only minor importance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increased airway resistance [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B14)].\nIn contrast, for body plethysmographic measurements of specific airway resistance (sRaw), or specific conductance (sGaw), which have lately been standardized and recommended by the 'Deutsche Atemwegsliga', only quiet breathing is required with a minimum of cooperation. The major part of airways resistance is localized in the first 8 to 12 bronchial generations and less in peripheral lungs. The peripheral lung, however, is incorporated in sRaw or sGaw by their volume related component. An increase of sRaw of ≥200% from baseline value and its absolute value larger than 2.0 kPa · s as well as a fall in sGaw ≥40% from baseline with an absolute value below 0.5 1/(kPa · s) are recommended by both international societies, ATS and ERS, to determine AHR. ATS and ERS consider both spirometry (FEV1) and body plethysmography (sReff and sGeff) for bronchoprovocation testing; comparative studies are, however, lacking.\nIn the present study, we compared both methods in order to evaluate the concordance of forced spirometry and body plethysmography, concerning their clinical value during MCH challenge testing in patients with confirmed bronchial asthma.\n##  Materials and Methods\n### Study Population\nCumulative MCH challenges test were performed in 155 patients (82 males, 73 females) with a mean age of 50.4 ± 15.9 years (range 18-84 years), 170 ± 10 cm height (range 154-194 cm) and a mean BMI of 28 ± 6.2 kg/m2 (range 16.8-48.9) during a clinical assessment of patients with chronic cough or suspected mild asthma referred to a 205-bed-center for pulmonology and thoracic surgery prospectively. None of the patients had any cardiac or pulmonary disease other than suspected asthma and none were receiving medication for upper or lower airway disease, other than inhaled short acting bronchodilators. Inclusion criteria: > 18 yr of age, non-smoker, no respiratory infection or exacerbation of asthma within the preceding 6 weeks; FEV1 ≥70% pred and ≥1.5 L, no previous treatment with oral or inhaled steroids. Subjects were interviewed by a pulmonologist, and asked to refrain from using caffeine-containing beverages, and gave informed written consent to the study.\n### Methacholine Challenges\nMethacholine chloride was dissolved in isotonic saline to a final concentration of 16 mg/ml. This standard MCH concentration was used at all provocation steps. The patients were advised to breathe tidal and slow without exceeding a maximal flow of 0.5 L/s. At inhalation after a time of 0.2 s, the nebulizer generated an aerosol bolus for defined periods of time (0.29 s, 0.59 s and 0.94 s). The MCH challenge procedure had the following design: after measuring baseline values and an initial inhalation of aerosolized isotonic saline, maximal 5 provocation steps (0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.201, and 0.401 mg) were performed. The challenge test was terminated by administration of the short acting bronchodilator. The APS provocation system (Cardinal Health, Höchberg, Germany) uses the effective and reliable nebulizer from MedicAid with an aerodynamic mass median diameter of particles of MMAD 3.2 μm, which is optimal size for effective sedimentation of the aerosol in the lung. The cumulative inhaled doses after each step of inhalation (0.025, 0.075, 0.175, 0.376, and 0.777 mg MCH) were obtained by taking two breaths with MCH boluses at step one and two, 4 breaths at step 3, 8 breaths at step 4, and 10 breaths at step 5. Classification of AHR was performed in four steps: severe (MCH dose < 0.05 mg), moderate (0.05 mg < MCH dose < 0.20 mg) mild (0.20 < MCH dose < 0.65 mg), and normal responsive (MCH dose > 0.65 mg).\n### Lung Function Measurements\nSpecific airway resistance (sRaw), specific conductance (sGaw), airway resistance (Raw), conductance (Gaw) and intrathoraxic gas volume (ITGV) were recorded by body plethysmography (MasterScreen Body, Cardinal Health, Höchberg, Germany). In the combined measurements, body plethysmography was performed first followed by forced spirometry. In both test the patient was sitting in upright position. To allow optimal instruction and motivation in the forced spirometric maneuver, the door of the plethysmograph was opened for this test. According to the recommendations of the manufactures the body plethysmograph was calibrated every morning.\nThe spirometric test results were compared to the reference equations of the ECCS [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B15)]. Classification of body plethysmography based on the current recommendations of Criee at al [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B16)]. At rest, after saline inhalation and after each step of MCH inhalation body plethysmography was measured 2 minutes after MCH inhalation, with determination of Reff, sReff, Rtot, sRtot, sGeff and sGtot, and ITGV [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B17)]. An increase of sRaw of ≥200% from 100% baseline value and its absolute value larger than 2.0 kPa · s or a fall in sGaw ≥40% and its absolute value lower than 0.5 1/(kPa · s) are recommended as thresholds to determine airways hyperresponsiveness. At baseline and after crossing the PD threshold in body plethysmography (PD+100 Raw, sRaw,) forced spirometric maneuvers were performed and FEV1, FVC, and FEV1 %FVC were determined and the PD-20 FEV1 extrapolated.\n### Data Analysis\nBecause the challenge needed to be stopped as soon as patients showed significant symptoms based on airway narrowing and assessed via PD+100 sRaw, most spirometric datasets were left incomplete with some parameters not reaching the diagnostic threshold PD-20 FEV1. Utilizing the regression analysis of the recorded airway resistance parameters taking the metacholine dose as the covariate, we could extrapolate to missing spirometric values and interpolate the estimated metacholine dose when crossing the threshold between two consecutive measurements.\nRegression was done in a simple 3-way process of transforming data into linear space, doing linear regression and back transformation, where linear regression was performed by built-in statistical functions of an Oracle© 10 g XE database. Quality checking was done by calculating the mean goodness-of-fit for each parameter which yielded the following results: Using regression analysis of the recorded airway parameters taking the MCH dose as the covariate we could extrapolate to missing values and interpolate the estimated MCH dose when crossing the threshold of -20% for FEV1, between two consecutive measurements. The regression analysis resulted in high values for the 'goodness of fit' (0.83 > r2 < 0.95). The required PD+100 MCH doses for airway, specific airway resistance (Rtot, Reff, sRtot, and sReff), and specific conductance (sGaw) were compared to PD-20 of FEV1.\n##  Results\n### Lung Function Parameters of Patients Included in the Study\nUnder baseline conditions, the mean values of respiratory parameters of males with mild asthma were in the normal range for sReff (mean 0.77 ± 0.036 kPa · s, range 0.26-1.6), FEV1 (3.51 ± 0.90 L, range 0.95-5.55, or 95% according ECCS reference values) and sGeff (mean 1.53 ± 0.63 1/kPa · s) (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#T1)). The mean baseline values for females corresponded to ECCS reference values for FEV1 (2.45 ± 0.60 L, range 1.23-4.16 L, or 95.5% predicted) and to plethysmographically measured sReff (0.835 ± 0.306 kPa · s, range 0.12-1.65) and sGeff (mean 1.37 ± 0.63 1/kPa · s).\n#### Table 1.\nBaseline respiratory parameters of patients with mild asthma included in the study.\n| FEV1  \n(L/s) | FEV1%  \nFVC (%) | Reff  \n(kPa/L · s) | sReff  \n(**kPa · s)** | Rtot  \n(kPa/L · s) | sRtot  \n(kPa · s) | sGeff  \n(1/kPa · s) | sGtot  \n(1/kPa · s)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Males, n = 82**  \nMW | **3.51** | **82.2** | **0.19** | **0.77** | **0.22** | **0.87** | **1.53** | **1.29**  \nSD | ± 0.91 | ± 7.60 | ± 0.07 | ± 0.36 | ± 0.07 | ± 0.34 | ± 0.62 | ± 0.41  \nMed | 3.47 | 83.2 | 0.19 | 0.71 | 0.22 | 0.80 | 1.41 | 1.26  \n**Females, n = 73**  \nMW | **2.45** | **85.0** | **0.26** | **0.84** | **0.29** | **0.92** | **1.40** | **1.19**  \nSD | ± 0.62 | ± 7.06 | ± 0.10 | ± 0.31 | ± 0.09 | ± 0.28 | ± 0.63 | ± 0.47  \nMed | 2.36 | 85.40 | 0.26 | 0.79 | 0.28 | 0.90 | 1.12 | 1.11  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/table/T1/)\n### Classification of Airway Hyperresponsiveness\nAccording to PD+100 sReff, 25 patients suffered from severe AHR, in 47 a moderate AHR was found, in 41 patients a mild airway AHR, and in another 41 patients normal responses with an increase in sReff < 2.0 kPa/L · s or < 100%. So a total of 113 patients (75%) showed positive MCH challenges based on sReff (Figure [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#F1)).\n#### Figure 1.\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef6c/3521367/18c8de3822e5/2047-783X-14-S4-170-1.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3521367_2047-783X-14-S4-170-1.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/figure/F1/)\n**Number of patients with MCH responses, classified as severe, moderate, mild, and normal, based on PD+100 for sReff, sRtot, Reff, Rtot, PD-40 for sGeff and sGRtot and PD-20 for FEV 1**.\nRegarding PD-40 sGeff with a decrease of 40% as the threshold value, 28 patients had severe, 58 patients moderate, and 45 mild AHR, whereas only 19 patients had normal responses, so 88% of the patients had positive test results by sGeff.\nTaking a fall in FEV1 > 20% of baseline value (PD-20 FEV1) as a criterion, only 6 patients had severe AHR, 23 had moderate responses, 21 had mild responses, and the majority of 104 patients had no response. So, 50 from the 154 patients (32%) had a positive test result with FEV1 (Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#F2)).\n#### Figure 2.\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef6c/3521367/9094e538ec58/2047-783X-14-S4-170-2.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3521367_2047-783X-14-S4-170-2.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/figure/F2/)\n**Accuracy of responses classified as severe, moderate, mild and normal, based on PD+100 for sReff, sRtot, Reff, Rtot, PD-40 for sGeff and sGRtot, and PD-20 for FEV 1**.\nThe mean MCH-dose for diagnosis of severe AHR was 0.026 ± 0.012 mg MCH.

The mean dose for a mild AHR was 0.356 ± 0.122 mg MCH.\nStatistical analysis revealed strongly linearly correlated parameters of airway resistance, but no significant relationship between the test results of body plethysmography and forced spirometry. PD+100 sReff and PD+100 sRtot significantly correlated in patients with severe, moderate and mild degree of AHR (Figure [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#F3)).

In cumulative MCH challenges, we found specific airway resistance (sReff) to be the most useful parameter in the detection of AHR. The measurement of specific airway resistance (sRaw) by body plethysmography is largely independent of patient's cooperation, facilitating the interpretation of measurements. Furthermore, higher MCH doses were necessary before FEV1, as a key parameter of forced spirometry, showed a significant decrease above 20%. Although most practitioners only measure FEV1, reliance upon this measurement alone can lead to both false negative and false positive test results.\nGoldstein et al [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B18)] reported that sensitivity of a MCH challenge determined by FEV1 alone was only 60%, but increased to 97% after the assessments of FVC, sGaw, and thoracic gas volume (TGV) were added to the analysis. This result is in accordance with the known axial heterogeneity of the response of airways of different caliber to bronchoactive agents. Furthermore, if patients not fully inhale to total lung capacity (TLC), a fall in FEV1 can occur and cause a false positive result. Generally, the sensitivity of a positive MCH challenge test for the diagnosis of asthma is 85%. A positive predictive value is more limited, as false positive results may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure, COPD, and bronchitis. [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B1),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B19)]. However, patients with allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, heart failure, or COPD were not included in this study.\n### Impact of Deep Inspirations during Forced Expiratory Maneuvers on MCH-Testing\nDeep breaths effectively modulate airway caliber. In healthy subjects, deep inhalations result in bronchodilatation and reduce pharmacologically induced airways obstruction [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B20)]. On the other hand, avoidance of maximal maneuvers enhances reactions of bronchoconstrictor agents [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B21)]. Taking deep breaths before bronchial challenge tests diminshes obstructive responses as a consequence [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B22),[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B23)]. Therefore, deep inspirations during forced expiratory maneuvers provide an effective protection against airways obstruction. However, the beneficial effects of deep inspirations are impaired in asthma [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B24),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B25)] and during acute exacerbations of asthma. In these clinical settings deep inspirations may even enhance obstructive responses [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B26)]. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchodilatory effects of deep inspirations are effectively reduced, which may depend on the degree of parenchymal damage [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B27)]. Airway inflammation is a typical feature of asthma and COPD, although the composition of inflammatory cells is different [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B28),[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B29)]. Inflammatory processes induce airway remodelling and thus increasing thickness of airway walls and reducing the elasticity of the airways [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B30)]. The result would be a reduced strain transmission from lung parenchyma to the airway walls and diminished effects of stretching the airways [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B31)].\nSlats et al [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B14)] demonstrated that the bronchodilatory effects of deep inspirations in asthma are related to inflammatory cell counts in bronchial walls and smooth muscle layers, whereas in moderate COPD this relationship could not be found. They conclude that the physiologic protection against narrowing of the airways by deep inspirations is impaired in asthma and COPD, but depends on different mechanisms.\n### Changes in Airway Resistance During Quiet Breathing\nUsing body plethysmography for the assessment of airway resistance responses, measurements are performed during quiet breathing and are not masked by the bronchodilatory responses of deep inhalations or positive intraluminal pressure in the airways. In addition, the results are largely independent of patients' cooperation. There was a close correlation between Reff and Rtot, the two parameters for airway resistance, which are calculated from different approaches, and the PD+100 of both parameters. In addition, specific airway resistance sReff and sRtot, including lung volume and changes in lung volume during airway obstruction, closely correlate. Since Raw and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) both increase during acute airway obstruction, the largest response rates can be recorded in sReff and sRtot. A close correlation was also found between specific airway resistance and specific conductance, sGaw, the reciprocal value of specific resistance. In further investigations, PD sGaw should be adjusted to PD+100 sReff.\n### Clinical Relevance of Non-Specific Challenge Testing\nAHR is an important defining feature of asthma and is a manifestation of reversible airflow obstruction due to smooth muscle contraction. AHR represents an exaggerated constrictor response to a variety of physical, chemical, or environmental stimuli. AHR can be quantified by the dose response to pharmacologic agents such as methacholine or histamine, causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline. While AHR is not specific for asthma, patients with asthma typically demonstrate AHR to much lower doses (e.g., 10- to 100-fold) of these agents than normal or allergic individuals. The single, most typical abnormality in many patients with asthma is AHR. As a result, the assessment of changes in AHR using bronchoprovocation testing may be preferable to the reliance upon subjective changes in symptoms alone. This is particularly relevant when asthma control requires a complex, costly, and potentially toxic therapeutic regimen. Thus, an appropriate bronchoprovocation testing is of high clinical relevance. Indications for bronchoprovocation testing include not only the accurate diagnosis of asthma, but also the assessment of the response to asthma therapy, and, less commonly, the identification of triggers for cases involving environmental or occupational asthma. The measurement of AHR by bronchoprovocation testing is potentially useful for several reasons: failure to show AHR argues against the diagnosis of asthma, AHR may be the sole objective evidence of airway dysfunction, AHR is quantitatively associated with the presence and severity of disease, the occurrence of AHR in an asymptomatic person may help predict the future development of asthma, the degree of AHR in a symptomatic person can have prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications, the periodicity of asthma exists in parallel with changes in the degree of AHR [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B32),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3521367/#B33)]. A false negative FEV1 in patients with asthma may have serious consequences for the patient due to undertreatment. Thus, recording responses of airway resistance by measurements performed during quiet breathing, which are not masked by the bronchodilatory responses of deep inspirations may increase the diagnostic impact of bronchoprovocation.\n##  Summary and Conclusion\nThe authors compared forced spirometry and body plethysmography in order to evaluate the concordance of the forced respiratory maneuvers and measurements of airway resistance during normal breathing in MCH challenges. PD+100 Raw and PD-40 Gaw for the following plethysmographically measured parameters Rtot, Reff, sRtot, sReff, sGtot, and sGeff, are closely correlated with cumulative MCH-challenge tests. Our results did not show a correlation of PD+100 sReff and PD-20 FEV1. The reason for the different responses might be found in the location of the plethymographically measured airway resistance and the flow reduction measured in forced spirometric maneuvers. From our results, we would recommend sReff and sGaw as the reliable parameters for classification of AHR. Additional investigations on healthy subjects and patients with asthma and COPD should be performed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of body plethysmography and forced spirometry for MCH-challenge tests.\n##  Conflicts of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n##  References\n  1.

We report the case of an 18-year-old male with a two-month history of MCNS who was admitted due to fever, cough, and bright red hemoptysis. Upon admission, he was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and moxifloxacin for one week; however, the therapeutic response was suboptimal. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) and microbiological culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified a pulmonary mixed infection involving _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , _S. maltophilia_ , and HCMV. Following the initiation of combination therapy with linezolid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir, the patient’s condition improved markedly, and he was discharged in a stable condition. One-year follow-up revealed complete recovery with no recurrence. This case highlights the critical role of incorporating advanced molecular diagnostic tools such as mNGS into clinical practice and the need to be vigilance about opportunistic infections involving multiple pathogens, especially in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.\n**Keywords:** metagenomic next-generation sequencing, pulmonary infection, _Nocardia cyriacigeorgica_ , _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ , _human cytomegalovirus_ , minimal change nephrotic syndrome\n##  Introduction\nMinimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is one of the most common causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B1)). Treatment typically involves the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which can induce immunosuppression and elevate the risk of opportunistic infections caused by pathogenic microbes ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B2)). _Nocardia cyriacigeorgica_ , _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ , and _human cytomegalovirus_ (HCMV) are opportunistic pathogens, with an increased risk of infection in patients with impaired immune function or preexisting pulmonary diseases. Co-infections involving these three pathogens are exceedingly rare, with no documented cases reported in the literature. This report describes a case of a young adult with MCNS who developed a mixed pulmonary infection involving _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , _S. maltophilia_ , and HCMV, identified through metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and bacterial culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Following targeted antimicrobial therapy, the patient achieved full recovery and was discharged.\n##  Case presentation\nAn 18-year-old male was admitted on September 11, 2023, presenting with fever, cough, and expectoration of bright red, blood-tinged sputum. Two months prior to admission, he had been diagnosed with MCNS and treated with methylprednisolone (40 mg once daily) and furosemide (20 mg twice daily). Upon admission, the prednisone dosage was reduced to 20 mg once daily due to severe infection and was discontinued two days later. Physical examination revealed a moon face, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and absence of audible rales. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: 24-hour urinary protein excretion of 15.46 g/24 h, serum albumin of 20 g/L, total cholesterol of 8.85 mmol/L, triglycerides of 3.04 mmol/L, and a complete blood count showing a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.47×109/L with a neutrophil percentage of 86.20%. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) was elevated to 116.81 mg/L, interleukin-6 (IL-6) to 33.3 pg/mL, blood glucose to 9.82 mmol/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate to 73 mm/h, and sputum smear demonstrated Gram-negative rods. Renal histopathology findings were consistent with MCNS. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a large high-density area with cavitation in the right upper lobe, along with scattered small patchy opacities and multiple small cavities in the apical segments ([ **Figure 1A** ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#f1)). The patient’s maximum recorded body temperature was 39.1°C. Despite one week of empirical antimicrobial therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and moxifloxacin, the patient’s condition persisted, characterized by fever, worsening cough, decreased hemoptysis, production of small amounts of white, viscous sputum, and the onset of dyspnea. Although WBC levels decreased to 9.89×109/L, IL-6 levels increased significantly to 69.864 pg/mL, and arterial blood gas analysis indicated mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an oxygenation index of 295 mmHg. Chest CT performed on September 18 revealed new diffuse multifocal patchy high-density areas and multiple cavity formations in both lungs ([ **Figure 1B** ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#f1)).\n### Figure 1.\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/58cd/12146331/14786c268376/fimmu-16-1599958-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12146331_fimmu-16-1599958-g001.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/figure/f1/)\nResults of Chest CT at different stages of the desease. **(A)** Chest CT showed a large patchy high-density lesion in the right upper lobe, associated with a large cavity. Scattered small patchy high-density lesions were also noted in the apical segment of the right upper lobe, some with small cavities. **(B)** Chest CT revealed the emergence of multiple diffuse, small patchy high-density lesions with poorly defined borders in both lungs, along with the development of multiple cavities. **(C)** Chest CT demonstrated a slight reduction in the size of the patchy high-density lesion in the right upper lobe apex compared to the prior examination. Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs showed signs of absorption, with a reduction in cavity sizes. **(D)** Chest CT showed gradual shrinkage and closure of multiple nodules and cavities.\nTo identify the infectious pathogens, bedside bronchoscopy was performed on September 19. Bronchoscopic examination revealed mild mucosal congestion and edema. BALF was collected for mNGS and microbial culture. mNGS analysis identified _S. maltophilia_ (175,079 reads, 29.1% coverage), _N. cyriacigeorgica_ (39,897 reads, 16.6% coverage), and HCMV (6,188 reads). Microbial culture further confirmed the presence of _S. maltophilia_ and Nocardia species in the BALF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for S. maltophilia demonstrated sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), levofloxacin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, and minocycline. Due to the unavailability of appropriate methods, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for Nocardia was not performed. BALF smear microscopy identified modified acid-fast positive Nocardia sp. with characteristic branching and filamentous structures ([ **Figure 2** ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#f2)). However, no Gram-negative bacilli were observed microscopically, and it is highly probable that the 7-day empirical antimicrobial therapy prior to bronchoscopy significantly reduced the bacterial load of _S. maltophilia_. In summary, the diagnosis was a pulmonary mixed infection involving _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , _S. maltophilia_ , and HCMV in a patient with MCNS. The treatment regimen was revised to include linezolid (600 mg q12h IV) combined with TMP-SMX (SMX 400 mg + TMP 80 mg, 3 tablets q6h orally). Given the patient’s history of kidney disease and prolonged corticosteroid use, which induced immunosuppression, ganciclovir (300 mg q12h IV) was initiated for HCMV treatment, with a planned discontinuation after two weeks.\n### Figure 2.\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/58cd/12146331/438ee0cc032f/fimmu-16-1599958-g002.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/figure/f2/)\nDirect modified acid-fast stain of BALF. Branching filaments were staining modified acid-fast positive.\nAfter one week of treatment, the patient’s body temperature and inflammatory markers normalized, and symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and expectoration were markedly improved. Chest CT performed on September 25 revealed a reduction in the right lung lesion, resolution of ground-glass opacities in both lungs, and a decrease in cavity size ([ **Figure 1C** ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#f1)). After two weeks of intravenous linezolid and TMP-SMX therapy, both medications were switched to oral administration. Two weeks later, linezolid was discontinued, while TMP-SMX (two tablets orally every six hours) was continued. At the three-month follow-up, chest CT scans demonstrated progressive closure of multiple nodules and cavities ([ **Figure 1D** ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#f1)). Consequently, the TMP-SMX dosage was adjusted to a prophylactic regimen. Due to the patient’s resumption of corticosteroid therapy for NS, TMP-SMX (1 tablet q12h orally) was prescribed as a prophylactic treatment and continued thereafter. After one year of follow-up, the patient remained in stable condition with no recurrence of infection.\n##  Discussion\nMCNS represents a prevalent etiology of NS. Epidemiological studies indicate that MCNS accounts for 70%-90% of pediatric NS cases ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B1)) and 10.9%-38.5% of adult NS instances ([3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B4)). The cardinal clinical features of NS encompass massive proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h) and hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), potentially accompanied by edema and hyperlipidemia ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B5)). Histopathological examination reveals essentially normal glomeruli under light microscopy with negative immunofluorescence, while electron microscopy demonstrates diffuse foot process effacement as the pathognomonic morphological feature of MCNS ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B1)). Prednisone or its active metabolite prednisolone, is the cornerstone of early treatment for MCNS. Additionally, frequent relapses often require second-line immunosuppressants to reduce hormone dependence ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B1)). The therapeutic use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, while effective, predisposes patients to immunosuppression-related complications, particularly opportunistic infections ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B2)). Notably, PubMed records only one documented case of _Nocardia_ infection in MCNS patients ([6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B6)), with no reported instances of _S. maltophilia_ or HCMV co-infections. This report presents the inaugural documented case of pulmonary co-infection involving _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , _S. maltophilia_ , and HCMV in a patient with MCNS.\n_N. cyriacigeorgica_ is an aerobic, Gram-positive, modified acid-fast positive, branching bacterium that is ubiquitously distributed in soil and aquatic environments worldwide. This pathogen can cause multi-systemic infections, most commonly affecting the lungs, brain, and skin. Pulmonary involvement constitutes the predominant site of infection, representing 62%-86% of clinical cases ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B5)). Browne et al. reported that pulmonary infections can disseminate to the brain ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B7)). As an opportunistic pathogen, _N. cyriacigeorgica_ poses particular risk to NS patients due to compromised renal function, glucocorticoid therapy, and immunosuppressive treatment ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B5)). _S. maltophilia_ , a Gram-negative bacillus, exhibits extensive ecological distribution across soil, plant surfaces, human and animal microbiota, and hospital settings ([8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B8)). Among non-fermenting bacteria, its prevalence ranks after only to _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_. This opportunistic pathogen primarily causes respiratory tract infections, establishing its significance as a nosocomial pathogen. HCMV (human herpesvirus 5), a double-stranded DNA virus, maintains a ubiquitous latent and persistent infection profile, with global seroprevalence rates ranging from 60% to 90% ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B9)). While most infections remain asymptomatic or manifest mild symptoms, immunocompromised individuals face substantial risk of severe infections, organ dysfunction, and mortality. Notably, Xue et al. demonstrated that patients with HCMV pneumonia received significantly higher corticosteroid doses and more frequent immunosuppressant administration compared to HCMV-infected individuals without pneumonia ([10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B10)).\nIn the management of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ infections, TMP-SMX has consistently demonstrated superior efficacy as the first-line therapeutic agent ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B5)). For severe or disseminated infections, a combination therapeutic regimen centered on TMP-SMX is recommended, supplemented by two or three different classes of additional antimicrobials, including third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime), carbapenems (e.g., imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem), amikacin, and linezolid ([5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B5)). In the management of _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ infections, the preferred initial approach typically involves a combination regimen based on TMP-SMX. It is recommended to select two antimicrobial agents with demonstrated activity (such as TMP-SMX, minocycline/tigecycline, cefiderocol, or levofloxacin) for combined therapy, maintaining this regimen until clinical improvement is achieved. For exceptional clinical scenarios—including rapid clinical deterioration, failure of alternative treatment strategies, or contraindications to other agents—a combination therapy comprising ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam may be considered as a therapeutic alternative ([11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B11)). Regarding HCMV management, clinicians generally adopt either universal prophylaxis or preemptive therapeutic strategies. The initiation of preemptive antiviral therapy should be based on quantitative PCR detection of CMV DNAemia. Systematic research evidence indicates that setting the preemptive therapy threshold at 2–3 log10 IU/mL significantly reduces the incidence of CMV disease ([12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B12)). Notably, despite the standardization of viral load reporting in international units, the establishment of a universal viral load threshold remains contentious ([13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B13)). Ganciclovir is the first-line antiviral treatment for HCMV infection. Depending on clinical circumstances, either intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir may be selected for therapeutic administration, significantly reducing the risk of HCMV-related complications and enhancing clinical outcomes ([14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B14), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B15)).\nThe patient manifested a triad of clinical symptoms: persistent cough, hemoptysis, and fever with a peak temperature of 39°C. Initial empirical antimicrobial therapy consisting of piperacillin/tazobactam combined with moxifloxacin was administered for seven days. Despite this intervention, the clinical condition deteriorated precipitously, culminating in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Serial lung CT imaging revealed progressive bilateral pulmonary involvement characterized by multiple patchy high-density shadows and cavitary lesions. The failure of empirical therapy to control disease progression highlighted the critical need for precise pathogen identification to guide targeted antimicrobial intervention. In this context, mNGS has emerged as an indispensable diagnostic tool, particularly for identifying rare, intractable and emerging pathogens. Consequently, BALF samples were collected for both mNGS analysis and conventional microbial culture. Both diagnostic modalities successfully identified _S. maltophilia_ and _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , while mNGS uniquely detected HCMV. Further clinical evaluation suggested that the patient’s prolonged glucocorticoid therapy for NS had induced a state of immunosuppression, significantly increasing vulnerability to opportunistic infections.\nFor the treatment of _N. cyriacigeorgica_ and _S. maltophilia_ , TMP-SMX represents the therapeutic cornerstone. Accordingly, a targeted antimicrobial regimen combining TMP-SMX with linezolid was initiated to optimize therapeutic efficacy and mitigate resistance development. Regarding HCMV management, while immunocompetent individuals with asymptomatic or mild infections typically do not require antiviral therapy, the patient’s two-month history of MCNS coupled with extended glucocorticoid use necessitated antiviral intervention to improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, ganciclovir (0.3 g q12h IV) was incorporated into the treatment regimen. Following two weeks of this comprehensive antimicrobial strategy, the patient demonstrated gradual temperature normalization and marked improvement in respiratory symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. Follow-up imaging studies showed resolution of bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates and significant reduction in cavitary lesions. Concomitant decreases in inflammatory markers further confirmed the efficacy of the targeted therapeutic approach. After three months of sustained treatment, complete resolution of the pulmonary infection was achieved. Considering the ongoing steroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome, the TMP-SMX dosage was transitioned from therapeutic to prophylactic levels (1 tablet q12h orally) and maintained. At the one-year follow-up evaluation, pulmonary imaging revealed complete resolution of exudative lesions and cavitary changes, with minimal residual fibrotic strands remaining.\nAs an untargeted high-throughput technology, mNGS allows comprehensive pathogen detection, offering distinct advantages for diagnosing rare, emerging, and polymicrobial infections ([16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B16), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B17)). This case also demonstrates the perfect combination of mNGS and traditional culture technologies to help accurately capture pathogens. However, several limitations exist: First, detected nucleic acids may originate from non-viable microorganisms, as current analytical methods cannot determine microbial viability. This discrepancy may be attributed to the persistence of non-viable _S. maltophilia_ DNA fragments post-treatment, as evidenced by negative microscopic findings despite elevated mNGS read counts in the present case. Technically, false-negative results may arise from various factors, including but not limited to NCBI database inaccuracies and/or inefficient bacterial nucleic acid release caused by suboptimal cell wall lysis protocols during sample preparation ([18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B18), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B19)). Furthermore, exogenous contamination and high host DNA ratios (>90%) may compromise detection reliability, necessitating remove DNA contamination from environmental microorganisms or hosts before data analysis ([20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B20), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B21)). Critically, clinical interpretation of microbial single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) necessitates validation via large-scale multicenter trials. Given the need for further verification of mNGS accuracy through prospective studies and its substantial cost ([22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B22)), conventional methods (e.g., PCR, serology) remain first-line for definitive pathogen identification. mNGS is optimally employed when: (1) conventional tests contradict strong clinical suspicion, or (2) rare/novel pathogen screening is required ([22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12146331/#B22)).\nThis case illustrates a rare pulmonary co-infection involving _N. cyriacigeorgica_ , _S. maltophilia_ , and potential HCMV infection, highlighting the critical need for comprehensive diagnostic strategies in immunocompromised patients with poor response to empirical antimicrobial therapy. The integrated application of imaging studies, conventional bacterial culture, and advanced mNGS technology enables accurate pathogen identification and facilitates targeted therapeutic interventions, ultimately enhancing clinical management and patient outcomes.\n##  Acknowledgments\nWe thank the medical and nursing team for treatment and care of the patients.\n##  Funding Statement\nThe author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.\n##  Data availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

COVID-19 disease is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and unfortunatly no drugs are currently approved against this desease. Accordingly, it is of outmost importance to review the possible therapeutic effects of naturally-occuring compounds that showed approved antiviral activities. The molecular docking approach offers a rapid prediction of a possible inhibition of the main enzymes Mpro and RdRp that play crucial role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. In the present work, we review the anti-viral activities of polyphenol compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids and stilbene) derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal _Vitis amurensis._ Recent molecular docking studies reported the possible binding of these polyphenols on SARS-CoV-2 enzymes Mpro and RdRp active sites and showed interesting inhibitory effects. This antiviral activity was explained by the structure-activity relationships of the studied compounds. Also, pharmacokinetic analysis of the studied molecules is simulated in the present work. Among the studied polyphenol compounds, only five, namely caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, naringenin and catechin have drug-likeness characteristics. These five polyphenols derived from _Vitis amurensis_ are promising drug candidates for the COVID-19 treatment.\n**Keywords:** COVID-19, Polyphenols, _Vitis amurensis_ , Drugs, Docking study\n##  1. Introduction\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was detected for the first time in December 2019 at Wuhan, China ([Zhu et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0765)). Then, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) was emerged as a pandemic. As of February 1st, 2022, more than 373.229 million cases and 5.658 million deaths were reported (www.who.int). SARS-CoV-2 disease is characterized by several symptoms such as dry cough, fever, headache, breath shortness, sore throat, production of sputum, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, loss of taste and smell as well as pneumonia. When multiple organs, mainly respiratory ones fail, the death occurs ([WHO 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0680)). The transmission of the COVID-19 is essentially due to the lack of approved drugs, which lead to a large increase in the number of untreatable infections that collapse the world healthcare system.\nDrug repurposing, also known as drug reprofiling, repositioning or re-tasking, is a strategy for identifying new uses for drugs that are outside the scope of the initial medical indication ([Ashburn and Thor 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0030)). This strategy suggested different anti-viral drugs to cure COVID-19 patients ([Muralidharan et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0450)). However, it should be noted that a specific drug needs to be approved for treating COVID-19 patients. Newly synthesized molecules were also tested for their potential inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome replication and transcription ([Bhardwaj et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0055)).\nTraditional herbal medicines are natural reservoir of molecules with anti-viral properties ([Huang et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0255), [Ghosh et al., 2021a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0185)). Considering the growing threat of COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to study the efficacy of such molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Polyphenols are a group of natural compounds that showed anti-viral properties against RNA viruses ([Wohlfarth and Efferth, 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0685), [Özçelik et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0500), [Rojas et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0560), [Weng et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0675)). Nowadays, such ployphenol compounds were _in silico_ screened for their SARS-CoV-2 proteases inhibition ([da Silva et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105), [Huang et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0255), [Kaviarasu and Naimuddeen, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0320)).\nIn the present work, we aimed to summarize the structure, the pathogenis and the main enzymes of the SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the polyphenol compounds derived from the Chinese therapeutic _Vitis amurensis_ that may be used as promising drug candidates in the COVID-19 therapy.\n##  2. Structure and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2\nSARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense enveloped RNA that belongs to the β-corona virus subgroup with a genome of about 30 Kb ([Wu et al. 2020a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0690)). SARS-CoV-2 has a typical genomic organization which is 5′untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame (ORFs) and genes encoded for spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapside (N) ([Wu et al. 2020a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0690)) ([Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0005)). ORF 1a and ORF 1b encode for two overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are further processed by viral-encoded proteases into 16 non specific proteins (nsp) essential for the replication and the transcription of the virus ([Paraskevis et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0505)).\n### Fig. 1.\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3425/9177455/7f167b148b67/gr1.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9177455_gr1.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/figure/f0005/)\nGenomic organization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2 [created with BioRender.com].\nSARS-CoV-2 also has a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein that makes it different from other coronaviruses ([Khailany et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0340)).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by S protein-host cell receptor interaction. The host cell serine proteases TMPRSS2 cleave the viral S protein into two subunits S1 and S2, which are responsible for the cell recognition and the membrane fusion ([Walls et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0655)). The S1 C-terminal domain binds to the host cell receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). As a result, a conformational change of the S2 subunit occurs allowing the release of the virus in the host cell cytoplasm then the viral RNA starts to express ([Zhou et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0755)). The viral genome starts translation into the viral polyproteins using the the host cell translation machinery ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0010)).\n### Fig. 2.\n[![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3425/9177455/fd71d1839476/gr2.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9177455_gr2.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/figure/f0010/)\nReplication cycle of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [created with BioRender.com]. (1) The virus entry to the host cell occurs after the recognition viral spike glycoprotein-ACE2 receptor, resulting in (2) endocytosis and viral genome release in the cytoplasm. (3) Autoproteolysis induces the cleavage of the viral polyproteins by the viral protease Mpro to form nonstructural proteins such as RdRp for the (4) viral RNA replication. The viral RNA (+sense) undergoes translation to form the structural proteins: N, S, E and M. S, E and M are processed in the ER (5) N is processed in the cytoplasm where it brings to the replicon of the viral RNA. (6) All the viral components are combined in the ER-golgi intermediate component (ERGIC) and (7) the formed virions are released inside vesicles then (8) secreted by exocytosis outside the cell.\n##  3. SARS-CoV-2 main enzymes\n### 3.1. Chymotrypsin-like protease (Mpro)\nChymotrypsin-like 3CLpro, also named Mpro and nsp5, is a cysteine protease. It is an important enzyme found in coronaviruses that has proteolytic function in the maturation stage of the virus. It cleaves at least 11 sites on polyprotein-1a (pp1a) and polyprotein-1ab (pp1ab) found in the viral genome to cut nsp4-nsp16 allowing the formation of several non-structural proteins such as RNA dependant RNA polymerase, helicase, endonuclease and 2′-_O_ -methyltransferase (2′-_O_ -Mtase) ([Hegyi et al. 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0230)).\n[Jin et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0290) showed that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is composed of three domains: (i) domain I contains the residues from 8 to 101, (ii) domain II contains residues from 102 to 184. Both domains I and II have an antiparallel β-barrel structure, (iii) domain III contains residues from 201 to 303 with five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster. Domain III is linked to domain II by a long loop region (residues 185–200). The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) active site is composed of Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Leu27, His41, Thr45, Met49, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, Met165, Glu166 and His172 ([Fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0015)). The Mpro His41-Cys145 dyad is responsible for the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2. His41-Cys145 is the most important target for drugs against coronaviruses ([Wu et al. 2020b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0695)). The inhibition of the catalytic dyad activity ultimately helps in the inhibition of the main protease activity ([Jin et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0290)). In fact, the inhibition of Mpro arrests the virus multiplication inside the host cell by blocking essential processes such as viral genome replication and transcription. The sequence of the Mpro is highly conserved through coronavirus species. This similarity exceed 96% when compared Mpro from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS ([Ghosh et al. 2021a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0185)). This makes Mpro an ideal target for broad-spectrum anti-CoV therapy.\n#### Fig. 3.\n[![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3425/9177455/2c7e12931f9f/gr3.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9177455_gr3.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/figure/f0015/)\nAmino acid residues involved in forming the active sites for **(A)** Mpro (PDB ID. 6LU7) and **(B)** RdRp (PDB ID. 6NUR) [from CASTp server ([www.sts.bioe.uic.edu](http://www.sts.bioe.uic.edu))]. Letters highlighted in blue color show the active site residues.\n### 3.2. RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp)\nRNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp), also known as nsp12, is a non-structural protein formed through the cleavage of the polyproteins by Mpro. RdRp is a crucial enzyme and plays an important role in both the replication and the transcription of the virus RNA ([Malik et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0420)). The RdRp expresses a minimal activity on its own, but the complexation with the co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 significantly stimulates its polymerase activity ([Subissi et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0635)). The COVID-19 virus RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR) active site is shown in [Fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0015). It consists of seven conserved motifs A-G. The motif C (residues Phe753 to Asn767) contains the catalytic residues (Ser759-Asp760-Asp761) which are important for the catalytic activity of the RdRp protease ([Jiang et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0285)). RdRp is a fundamental target for the treatment against COVID-19 since it provides a possible strategy against viral replication ([Wu et al. 2020b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0695)). It is of outmost importance to note that RdRp enzymes in coronaviruses are remarkably similar. In fact, the SARS-CoV RdRp exhibits ∼ 97% sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV-2 ([Singh et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0615)). It is also important to mention that there is no human polymerase counterpart that resembles the sequence/structural homology with coronaviruses RdRp ([Borgio et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0060)). Accordingly, the development of RdRp inhibitors would be potential therapeutic strategy with no risk of crosstalk with human polymerases.\n##  4. Botanical description and therapeutic uses of _Vitis amurenis_\n_Vitis amurensis_ is a wild grape species of Vitaceae family. The leaves have light green color and an alternate arrangement ([Peng et al. 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0525)). The branches are spread and can reach 15 m long in the whole growth. _Vitis amurensis_ is generally dioecious species. However, few forms of hermaphroditic flowers were reported in the literature ([Peng et al. 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0525)). In dioecious _Vitis amurensis_ , male vines produce only functionally male flowers and no mature berries are available ([Shen et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0590)). The flower buds start to differentiate from August to September ([Peng et al. 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0525)). The berries are small and round with a diameter ranging from 5 to 12 mm ([Liu and Li 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0400)). They have fine taste and 2 to 4 seeds ([Peng et al. 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0525)). _Vitis amurensis_ is resistant to the abiotic and biotic stresses ([Huang and Lin, 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0245), [Song et al., 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0620)). For that reason, it is often used to breed new cultivars tolerant/resistant to cold and diseases.\n_Vitis amurensis_ has high medicinal values. It was listed in the Korean herbal Pharmacopoeia (1987) for the treatment of stroke and the stimulation of memory improvement. The Chinese medicine used the _Vitis amurensis_ leaves, stems and roots to treat pains resulting from abdominal complaints, stomachache and neuralgic cancer ([Huang and Lin 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0245)). _Vitis amurensis_ berries are often given to the consumers as a rich source of soluble sugars (glucose and fructose), proteins, vitamins and secondary metabolites ([Zhang and Li 2000](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0735)). It was found that polyphenols extracted from _Vitis amurensis_ stems exhibit potential neuraminidase inhibitory activity ([Nguyen et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0460)). [Chen et al. (2018)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0080) showed that _Vitis amurensis_ leaf, stem and berry are beneficial as food supplement against influenza virus (IAV) subtype H1N1. However, as far as the authors are aware, the anti-viral activity of _Vitis amurensis_ has not been fully analyzed and whether it can exhibit any anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by inhibiting the proteolitic activity of Mpro and RdRp is not yet discussed. The present work fulfills the progress on polyphenol studies of _Vitis amurensis_ over the past decades and lists their inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and RdRp with the aid of _in silico_ docking results.\n##  5. Phenolic phytochemicals in _Vitis amurensis_\n_Vitis_ spp. polyphenols show an increasing interest for their nutraceutical, pharmacological, and cosmetic benefits ([Dani et al. 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0120)). Phytochemical studies revealed the presence of 140 phenolic compounds among which phenolic acids, flavonoids and stilbenes in _Vitis amurensis_ ([Huang and Lin, 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0245), [Wang et al., 2000](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0660), [Ha et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0215), [Zhao et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745), [De la Cruz et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0130), [Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)). Phenolic acids are divided into two main groups hydroxybenzoic acids with 7 carbon atoms (C6-C1) (_e.g._ gallic acid) and hydroxycinnamic acids with 9 carbon atoms (C6-C3) (_e.g._ caffeic acid, ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid) ([Silva et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0605)). Flavonoids form a group of diverse compounds that share a common diphenylpropane skeleton formed by 2 benzene rings connected by a linear three-carbon chain (C6-C3-C6). Flavonoids have, commonly, three OH groups, two of which are located in the ring A (at 5 and 7 positions) and one is located in the 3′ position of the ring B. Flavonoids can be found as free or bounded to glucose, galactose, rhamnose or xylose to form glycosides ([Majewska-Wierzbicka and Czeczot 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0415)). The main flavonoid subclasses found in _Vitis amurensis_ include flavonols (_e. g._ quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin), flavonones (_e.g._ naringenin), flavan-3-ols (_e.g._ catechin, epicatechine and epigallocatechin gallate), flavones (_e.g._ luteolin) and anthocyanins (_e.g._ cyanidin and peonidin). Stilbenes constitute a small group of polyphenolic compounds characterized by a (C6-C2-C6) 1,2-diphenylethylene skeleton ([Chong et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0090)) and most plant stilbenes are _trans_ -resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-_trans_ -stilbene) derivatives. In _Vitis amurensis_ up to 92 stilbene compounds were isolated and most of them are dimers, trimers, tetramers and pentamers ([Shen et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0585)).\n##  6. _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenols with the potential to inhibit COVID-19\nThe structures of the studied polyphenol compounds are shown in [Fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0020) and their anti-viral activities were tested ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0005)). These natural secondary metabolites include phenolic acids, flavonoids and a stilbene.\n### Fig. 4.\n[![Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3425/9177455/31d3be4ae5c0/gr4.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9177455_gr4.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/figure/f0020/)\nChemical structure of the studied _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenols [molecules are drawn with ChemDraw 20.0]\n### Table 1.\nAntiviral effects of polyphenols derived from _Vitis amurensis._\nCompound | Part of the plant | Virus | References  \n---|---|---|---  \n**1** | Grape skin | HCoV-NL63  \nIAV  \nHPIV3, HSV-1 |  [Weng et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0675), [You et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0725), [Özçelik et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0500)  \n**2** | Berry | HRVs  \nHBV, HCV |  [Park et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0510), [Wohlfarth and Efferth, 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0685)  \n**3** | Berry | HCoV-NL63  \nHBV  \nHPIV3  \nInfluenza, HIV |  [Zhang et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0740), [Wang et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0670), [Özçelik et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0500), [Maruta and He, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0435)  \n**4** | Grape skin | MHV | [Kim et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0345)  \n**5** | Grape skin | HSV  \nADV-11  \nEV71  \nIAV  \nPPV |  [Chiang et al., 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0085), [Yarmolinsky et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0715)  \n[Li al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0390)  \n[Liu et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0405), [Sheng et al., 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0595)  \n**6** | Root | SARS-CoV  \nIAV  \nHCV  \nEV71 |  [Nguyen et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0460), [Liu et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0405), [Rojas et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0560), [Yao et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0710)  \n**7** | Berry, leaf | HIV  \nIAV  \nHBV |  [Lee et al., 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0365), [Fan et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0150), [Nosrati et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0470)  \n**9** | Grape skin | IAV(H1N1 and H9N1) | [Jeong et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0275)  \n**10** | Berry | SARS-CoV  \nHIV, MULV,   \nM−MULV |  [Yu et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0730), [Ono et al., 1990](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0480),[Ono et al. 1990](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0480)  \n**11** | Berry | HCV  \nDENV-2  \nCHIKV |  [Khachatoorian et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0330), [Frabasile et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0175), [Ahmadi et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0015)  \n**12** | Berry, Grape skin | IAV | [You et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0725)  \n**13** | Leaf | HSV-1  \nHBV  \nHPV  \nHCV  \nDENV  \nPRRSV  \nEBOV  \nHIV  \nIAV |  [Colpitts et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)  \n[He et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0220), [He et al., 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0225)  \n[Colpitts et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)  \n[Raekiansyah et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0550), [Zhao et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0750), [Reid et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0600), [Li et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0385)  \n[Colpitts et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)  \n**14** | Berry | SARS-CoV | [Zhuang et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0770)  \n**16** | leaf, stem and root | HCV  \nHIV |  [Lee et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0375), [Pflieger et al., 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0535)  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/table/t0005/)\n### 6.1. Phenolic acids\nPhenolic acids are polyphenolic compounds present mainly in _Vitis amurensis_ berry and grape skin ([Zhao et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745), [Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)). Gallic acid (**1**) is a simple hydroxybenzoic acid that is found as free form in _Vitis amurensis_ grape skin ([Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280), [Chen et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0080)). It has a potent antiviral effect. For example, it has a strong anti-HCoV-NL63 (Human coronavirus NL63) potential ([Weng et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0675)). Compound **1** showed also an anti-IAV ([You et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0725)) as well as an anti-parainfluenza type 3 virus (HPIV3) and an anti-herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1) potency ([Özçelik et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0500)). A virtual molecular docking study investigating commercial drugs inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) showed that compound **1** induces hydrogen binding with the amino acid residues Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, His163 and Glu166 with a binding energy of −4.5 Kcal/mol ([Arokiyaraj et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0025)) which makes it a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0010)). Compound **1** has several potential therapeutic properties including antioxidant, anticancer and antimicrobial ([Ow and Stupans, 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0495), [Yilmaz and Toledo, 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0720)). Furthermore, **1** possesses an anti-inflammatory activity in both nude mice and human cell lines ([Faried et al., 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0155), [Kaur et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0315)). Inflammatory disorders are mainly characterized by the production of significant amounts of nitrogen reactive species (NOS), free radicals species (ROS) and cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α ([Federico et al. 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0165)). The inhibition of the cytokines, recognized as pro-inflammatory, was identified as a target for anti-inflammatory therapies. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of **1** is due to its ability to suppress IL-6 expression ([BenSaad et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0045)).\n#### Table 2.\nSummary of potential _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenol compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\nCompound | Binding energy (Kcal/mol) | Mpro residues interacting with polyphenol compounds through hydrogen bonding and other interactions | References  \n---|---|---|---  \n**1** | −4.5 | Leu141, Gly143, SER144, His163,Glu166 | [Arokiyaraj et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0025)  \n**2** | −8.9 |  **His41** , Met49, Asn142, Gly143, **Cys145** , Glu166 | [Adelusi et al. 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0010)  \n**3** | −5.7 | Gly143, Ser144, **Cys145** , His163 | [Kumar et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0355)  \n**4** | −5.4 | Glu14, Met17, Gly71 | [Salman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0565)  \n**5** | −6.0 |  **His41** , Phe140, Leu141, His163, Glu166, Thr190 | [Patil et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0515)  \n**6** | −8.5 |  **His41** , His164, Met165, Glu166, Asp187, Thr190, Gln192 | [Khaerunnisa et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0335)  \n**7** | −8.5 |  **His41** , **Cys145** , Met165, Glu166, Arg188, Gln189 | [da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)  \n**8** | −9.8 | Thr25, Met49, Tyr54, Phe140, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, His163, Met165, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189 | [Bhatia et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0050)  \n**9** | −8.9 |  **His41** , Met49, **Cys145** , Met165, Glu166, Thr190 | [da silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)  \n**10** | −6.5 | Thr26, **His41** , Leu141, Gly143 | [Sharma et al. 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0580)  \n**11** | −7.8 | His163, **Cys145** , Gly143, Gln189, Pro168 | [Jannat et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0270)  \n**12** | −7.9 |  **His41** , Met49, His164, Met165, Glu166, Asp187, Thr190, Gln192 | [Kaviarasu et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0320)  \n**13** | −7.6 | Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Leu27, **His41** , Thr45, Ser46, Met49, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, **Cys145** , Glu166, Gln189, Gln192 | [Ghosh et al. 2021b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0190)  \n**15** | −8.4 | Thr26, Met49, Leu141, Gly143, **Cys145** , Glu166, Asp187, Gln189 | [Islam et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0265)  \n**16** | −8.4 | Thr24, **His41** , Met49, His163, Met165 | [Joshi et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295)  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/table/t0010/)\n*Mpro catalytic dayd (His41 and Cys145) residues are highlighted with bold font.\n**1** , gallic acid; **2** , ellagic acid; **3** , caffeic acid; **4** , ferulic acid; **5** , chlorogenic acid; **6** , quercetin; **7** , quercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide: **8** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -glucuronide; **9** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -rutinoside; **10** , myricetin; **11** , naringenin; **12** , catechin; **13** , epigallocatechin gallate; **15** , cyanidin-3-_O_ -glucoside; **16** , δ-viniferin.\nEllagic acid (**2**) is a dimeric derivative of gallic acid. It is a phenolic acid found in the _Vitis amurensis_ berry ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)). It is known for its antioxidant activity. It inhibits _in vitro_ lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes ([Osawa et al. 1987](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0485)). An anti-inflammatory activity against the inflammation, caused by the Acute Lung Injury, was also reported for **2** ([Favarin et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0160)). The results of [Losso et al. (2004)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0410) showed that **2** has an anti-proliferative activity and induces apoptosis in Caco-2, Hs 578 T and MCF-7 cancer cells with no toxic effects on the viability of normal human lung fibroblast cells. Furthermore, **2** is known for its potential anti-viral activity, mainly against human rhinoviruses (HRVs) ([Park et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0510)). Compound **2** exhibits both anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) functions ([Wohlfarth and Efferth 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0685)). A molecular docking analysis of **2** against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme (PDB ID: 6LU7) showed that it interacts through hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with the amino acid residues His41, Met49, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145and Glu166 with a binding energy of −8.9 Kcal/mol ([Adelusi et al. 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0010)) ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0010)). Compound **2** interacts with the RdRp residues Thr246, Arg249, Ser255 and Pro461 with a docking energy of −7.6 Kcal/mol ([Gowrishankar et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0205)) ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0015)).\n#### Table 3.\nSummary of potential _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenol compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.\nCompound | Binding energy (Kcal/mol) | RdRp residues interacting with polyphenol compounds through hydrogen bonding and other interactions | Reference  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2** | −7.6 | Thr246, Arg249, Ser255, Pro461 | [Gowrishankar et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0205)  \n**6** | −7.2 | Asp452, Lys545, Arg553, Ala554, Arg624, Ser682 | [Abd El-Aziz et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0005)  \n**7** | −8.0 | Trp617, Tyr619, **Asp760** , **Asp761** , Trp800, Glu811, Cys813 | [da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)  \n**8** | −7.9 | Trp617, Tyr619, Cys622, **Asp760** , **Asp761** , Trp800, Glu811, Cys813 | [da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)  \n**9** | −9.2 | Trp617, Asp623, **Asp760** , Lys798, Glu811 | [da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)  \n**10** | −7.2 | Trp617, Asp618, Tyr619, Cys622, **Asp760** , **Asp761** , Lys798, Trp800, Glu811, Phe812 | [Singh et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0615)  \n**11** | −5.7 | Arg553, Arg555, Thr556, Ser682 | [Abd El-Aziz et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0005)  \n**13** | −5.7 | Lys603, Tyr606, Asp608, Pro612, Leu805, Thr806, Tyr826 | [Mhatre et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0445)  \n**14** | −9.8 | Tyr456, Arg555, Thr556, Tyr619, Pro620, Lys621, Asp623, Arg624, Thr680, Ser682, Thr687, Ala688, Asn691, **Ser759** , **Asp760** | [Iheagwam and Rotimi 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0260)  \n**16** | −8.3 | Ser514, Arg553, Asp616, Asp623, **Asp761** , Ala762, Trp800 | [Joshi et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295)  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/table/t0015/)\n*RdRp catalytic residues (Ser759, Asp760 and Asp761) are highlighted with bold font.\n**2** , ellagic acid; **6** , quercetin; 7, quercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide: **8** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -glucuronide; **9** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -rutinoside; **10** , myricetin; **11** , naringenin; **13** , epigallocatechin gallate; **14** , procyanidin B1; **16** , δ-viniferin\nCaffeic acid, ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid (compounds **3** , **4** and **5,** respectively) are hydroxycinnamic acids abundant in _Vitis amurensis_ grape skin and berry ([Zhao et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745), [Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)). Compound **3** is also found in coffee (_Coffea arabica_) and tea (_Camellia sinensis_ L.) ([Das and Eun 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0125)). It was shown that **3** inhibits several viruses such as HBV ([Wang et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0670)) and HPIV3 ([Özçelik et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0500)). Also, cell experiments proved that **3** influences the catalytic activity of HCoV-NL63 by blocking the virus attachment and limiting, therefore, its replication ([Zhang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0740)). Furthermore, **3** was described as a blocker of PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1) ([Xu et al. 2005](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0700)) which is the major “pathogenic” kinase. The abnormal activation of PAK1 causes a large variety of diseases/disorders including inflammation, malaria and pandemic viral infections such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ([Maruta and He 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0435)). A docking analysis on the role of **3** as a ligand for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) proved its ability to interact with the target enzyme through hydrogen bonds with the residues Gly143, Ser144, Cys145 and His163 and a binding energy of −5.7 Kcal/mol ([Kumar et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0355)). For these reasons, **3** is considered as a potential inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\nCompound **4** is a ubiquitous natural phenolic phytochemical. It is commonly found in various plants such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, flowers, beans, coffee and nuts ([Kumar and Pruthi 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0350)). Compound **4** is an antioxidant ([Ferreira et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0170)). It also has an anti-inflammation effect (especially in the lungs) and it protects the lungs against the viral infections by the amplification of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and the mitochondrial anti-viral-signaling protein (MAVS) signaling functions ([McCarty and DiNicolantonio 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0440)). The anti-viral activity of **4** was proved against the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) ([Kim et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0345)). Data of molecular docking showed that **4** binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein (PDB ID: 6LU7) through hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues Glu14, Met17, Gly71 with a binding energy of −5.4 Kcal/mol ([Salman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0565)). Nonetheless, **4** has better interactions with the three structural proteins: E (PDB ID: 2MM4), M (PDB ID: 4f91B) and N (PDB ID: 6M3M) ([Bhowmik et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0065)).\nCompound **5** is an ester, formed between caffeic acid and quinic acid. It is abundant in _Vitis amurensis_ grape skin ([Ji et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)). Compound **5** has noteworthy pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-tumor, anti-coagulant and anti-viral ([Hu et al., 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0240), [Chen et al., 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0075)). It was shown that **5** plays a significant role in preventing the viral infection in the early stages of the virus growth. For example, it has a strong inhibitory effect against porcine parvovirus (PPV) ([Sheng et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0595)). _In vitro_ anti-viral experiments revealed a concentration dependent effect of **5** on HSV infection ([Yarmolinsky et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0715)). Besides, **5** is an inhibitor of the adenovirus ADV-11 ([Chiang et al. 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0085)), the enterovirus EV71 ([Li et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0390)) and IAV (H1N1) ([Liu et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0405)). The work of [Patil et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0515), based on _in silico_ results, showed that **5** interacts with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) through hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues His41, Phe140, Leu141, His163,Glu166 and Thr190 ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0010)). These interactions have a binding energy of −6.0 Kcal/mol. Consequently, **5** can be considered as potential candidate for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.\n### 6.2. Flavonoids\nFlavonoids, which are an important class of polyphenols in _Vitis amurensis_ , are present mainly in berry, grape skin, seed, root and leaf ([Wang et al., 2000](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0660), [Zhao et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745), [Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280), [Kedrina-Okutan et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0325)). Flavonoids are bioactive compounds and they have various health-promoting effects. They can be used as drugs to prevent ROS regeneration ([Lale et al. 1996](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0360)). The anti-viral activity of many flavonoids was reported against various viral strains. Flavonoids exert their anti-viral effects through the blockage of cellular receptors, inhibition of the viral antigenic determinants and the loss of enzymatic functions ([Evers et al. 2005](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0145)).\nQuercetin (**6**) is considered as one of the most important flavonoids, mainly flavonols-type in _Vitis amurensis_ root ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)). Compound **6** is ubiquitously present in various vegetables such as peas (_Pisum sativum_), onion (_Allium cepa_), in fruits such as apple (_Malus pumila_), mulberry (_Morus alba_), apricot (_Prunus armeniaca_) and in medicinal plants such as Jaman (_Eugenia jambolana_ Lam.), neem (_Azadirachta indica_), arjan (_Terminalia arjuna_), peepal (_Ficus religiosa_) and aloevera (_Aloe barbadensis_) ([Sultana and Anwar 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0640)). Compound **6** has several potential biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-viral ([D’Andrea, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0100), [Liu et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0405)). The anti-viral activity of **6** was essentially displayed against HCV ([Rojas et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0560)), IAV ([Liu et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0405)), EV71 ([Yao et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0710)) and SARS-CoV ([Nguyen et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0460)). Also, **6** has anti-viral effects on SARS-CoV-2. [Khaerunnisa et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0335) used molecular docking study to prove the ability of **6** to bind with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) at the residues His41, His164, Met165, Glu166, Asp187, Thr190 and Gln192 with a binding energy of −8.5 Kcal/mol ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0010)). These interactions have different electrostatic nature (van der Walls, π-π and π-sulfur). Compound **6** can bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (-7.2 Kcal/mol) and it is described as a candidate for RdRp inhibiting ([Abd El-Aziz et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0005)) ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0015)). It is now well established that the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high levels of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 and interferon γ ([Lee et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0380)). [Huang et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0255) indicated that the cytokine storm contributes to the disease severity and the use of the corticosteroids at the early acute infection stages may be beneficial. For this reason, the use of the anti-inflammatory agents may be considered as a promising treatment approach to relieve COVID-19 symptoms ([Stebbing et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0630)). Accordingly, **6** is a potent candidate against inflammations due to the COVID-19 proliferation. Indeed, **6** inhibits interleukins production and regulates the TNF and AMP activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways ([Kashyap et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0310)). In addition, **6** is recognized as a treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. It can slow down the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting the AKT1 expression which leads to the silence of the anti-apoptotic effect of lung fibroblast ([Hohmann et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0235)). Noteworthy, **6** decreases pulmonary arterial pressure by abolishing the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and it slows down the plate-derived growth factor β signaling pathways. Thus, the cardiovascular protective effects of **6** are due to the equilibrium between ACE2-Ang1-7-Mas and ACE-AngII-AT1R ([Dang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0115)). For all these reasons, we suggest that the use of **6** can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nQuercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide (**7**) is a quercetin derivative that is widely distributed in _Vitis amurensis_ berry ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)) and it forms 70.4% of the total flavonols in leaves ([Kedrina-Okutan et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0325)). Several works pointed out an anti-inflammatory activity as well as effective anti-HIV, anti-IAV and anti-HBV activities of **7** ([Lee et al., 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0365), [Fan et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0150), [Nosrati et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0470)). [Fan et al. (2011)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0150) indicated that **7** can suppress lung edema induced by IAV in mice. [da Silva et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105) showed that **7** is a promising SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor for the two enzymes Mpro and RdRp. In fact, a molecular docking analysis confirmed its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6W63) active site through hydrogen bonds and π interactions with the amino acid residues His41, Cys145, Met165, Glu166, Arg188 and Gln189 with a binding energy of −8.5 Kcal/mol. The interaction of **7** with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) active site, at residues Trp617, Tyr619, Asp760, Asp761, Trp800, Glu811 and Cys813, has a binding energy of −8.0 Kcal/mol ([da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)). The interaction of **7** with the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 for the Mpro as well as Asp760, Asp761 for the RdRp ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0010), [Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0015)) suggests that it can play an important role in the prevention and the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.\nKaempferol-3-_O_ -glucuronide (**8**) is a flavonol glycoside abundant in _Vitis amurensis_ grape skin ([Ji et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)) and leaf ([Kedrina-Okutan et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0325)). It is known as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ([Wang and Zheng, 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0665), [Shankaran et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0575)). Compound **8** is synthesized in the liver through the conjugation of kaempferol with glucuronate then it is transported in plasma to the body tissues ([Marín et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0430)). According to this finding, **8** can be considered as a promising inhibitor for the SARS-CoV-2 since the virus is abundant in the plasma. [Bhatia et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0050) detected, through a virtual screening based on molecular docking analysis, that **8** binds to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro (PDB ID: 6LU7) through one hydrogen bond with the residue His163 and several van der Waals interactions with the amino acids Thr25, Met49, Tyr54, Phe140, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Met165, Asp187, Arg188 and Gln189 with a binding energy of −9.8 Kcal/mol. Also, **8** was described as a potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor. In fact, the docking analysis of **8** on the active site of the RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) showed that it forms hydrogen bonds, π-anion and π-alkyl interactions with a binding energy of −7.9 Kcal/mol ([da Silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)). The hydrogen bonds are formed with the amino acid residues Trp617, Tyr619, Asp761, Trp800, Glu811 and Cys813. The π-anion interactions are formed with the key enzyme residues Asp760 and Asp761. The π-alkyl interactions are formed with Cys622 and Cys813 ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0015)).\nKaempferol-3-_O_ -rutinoside (nicotiflorin) (**9**), which is abundant in _Vitis amurensis_ grape skin ([Ji et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280)) has interesting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities ([Gamal-Eldeen et al. 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0180)). Also, it was shown that **9** has an anti-IAV (H1N1 and H9N1) activity ([Jeong et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0275)) and it displays an active potential against Mpro and RdRp enzymes of the SARS-CoV-2. The docking results of [da silva et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105) showed that **9** presents π-π, π-sigma and π-sulfur interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6W63) catalytic dyad His41 and Cys145. Furthermore, **9** shows an affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) catalytic residue Asp760 through hydrogen bond and π-anion interaction ([da silva et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0105)).\nMyricetin (**10**) is a natural flavanol that occurs in _Vitis amurensis_ berry ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)). Compound **10** reveals antioxidant properties due to its ability to scavenge ROS. For example, it inhibits the malonaldehyde (MDA) formation in rat liver microsomes ([Robak and Gryglewski 1988](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0555)) and it has lipogenase activity in the rat liver cytosol ([Pereira and Das 1991](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0530)). Additional pharmacological benefits of **10** arise from its use as anticarcinogenic ([Ong and Khoo 1997](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0475)) and in the prevention of platelet aggregation ([Tzeng et al. 1991](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0645)). Compound **10** is also recognized as an antitussive molecule in the Indian medicine ([Joshi et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295)). Its anti-viral potential is due to its ability to inhibit the reverse transcriptase in rauscher murine leukemia virus (MULV), moloney murine leukemia virus (M−MULV) and HIV ([Ono et al. 1990](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0480)). [Yu et al. (2012)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0730) presented **10** as SARS-CoV inhibitor since **10** interferes with the residues of the SARS-CoV helicase ATPase and it restrains its activity. It was proved that **10** can be used as a potent inhibitor against nsp15 of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, **10** showed a binding energy of −6.5 Kcal/mol when it interacts with the Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) amino acid residues Thr26, His41, Leu 141 and Gly143 ([Sharma et al. 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0580)).\nCompound **10** exhibits a high binding affinity towards the active site of RdRp of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and therefore it can be anticipated to prevent the viral RNA replication ([Yu et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0730), [Singh et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0615)). Indeed, a recent _in silico_ study affirmed that **10** binds to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) active site at the amino acids residues Trp617, Asp618, Tyr619, Cys622, Asp760, Asp761, Lys798, Trp800, Glu811 and Phe812 with a binding energy of −7.2 Kcal/mol ([Singh et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0615)).\nNaringenin (**11**) is the aglycon of naringin which is recognized as the bitter component of the citrus fruits ([Ameer et al. 1996](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0020)). In _Vitis amurensis_ , **11** occurs in berry ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)). It has potential biological benefits such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ([Den Hartogh and Tsiani 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0135)). Compound **11** exerts inhibitory effects against HCV ([Khachatoorian et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0330)), dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) ([Frabasile et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0175)) and it stops intracellular replication of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) ([Ahmadi et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0015)). Recent studies suggest that **11** acts as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 ([Jannat et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0270), [Stebbing et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0630)). The binding energy determined from the docking of **11** on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) active site is equal to −7.8 Kcal/mol. This binding energy is due to the hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues His163, Cys145 and Gly143 as well as one carbon hydrogen bond and one π-alkyl interaction with respectively, the residues Gln189 and Pro168 ([Jannat et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0270)). Docking analysis results of **11** on SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) reveled the existence of hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues Arg553, Arg555, Thr556 and Ser682 with a binding energy of −5.7 Kcal/mol ([Abd El-Aziz et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0005)).\nThe interaction of **11** with the catalytic Cys145 is a limiting factor for the SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, **11** has the advantage of relieving COVID-19 symptoms ([Stebbing et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0630)). As mentioned previously, **11** has a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, it can be considered as an alternative agent for decreasing cytokine levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, IFNγ) in COVID-19 patients.\nCatechin (**12**) and epigallocatechin gallate (**13**) are polyphenolic flavan-3-ols existing in _Vitis amurensis_ berry, grape skin and leaf ([Zhao et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745), [Ji et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0280), [Kedrina-Okutan et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0325)). Compound **12** is also found in tea (_Camellia sinensis_ L.) ([Ghosh et al. 2021b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0190)). Catechins are known for their multiple health benefits such as anti-inflammatory ([Yang et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0705)), antioxidant ([Singh et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0610)), anti-tumor ([Ann Beltz et al. 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0040)) and anti-allergic ([Mancini et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0425)). Previous studies showed that catechins have potent anti-viral activities. Indeed, **12** was described as an anti-pandemic IAV (H1N1) ([You et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0725)). Compound **13** has a strong anti-viral activity for many viruses. In fact, negative effects of **13** were reported on several DNA viruses such as HSV-1 ([Colpitts and Schang 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)), HBV ([He et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0220)) and papillomavirus (HPV) ([He et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0225)). Also, the negative effect of **13** on (+)-RNA viruses were proved on HCV ([Colpitts and Schang 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)), DENV ([Raekiansyah et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0550)) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) ([Zhao et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0750)). What is more, **13** was identified as a potent against (-)-RNA viruses such as ebola virus (EBOV) ([Reid et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0600)), HIV ([Li et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0385)) and IAV ([Colpitts and Schang 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0095)). Compound **13** blocks the early stages of viruses infection, that are attachment and genome replication ([Kaihatsu et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0305)). Nowadays, many academic researchers are focusing on the use of catechins as eventual drugs to alleviate SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the docking of **12** with the main SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) showed six hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues His164, Glu166, Asp187, Thr190 and Gln192 as well as other non-covalent interactions with the residues His41, Met49 and Met165 with a binding energy of −7.9 Kcal/mol ([Kaviarasu et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0320)). [Ghosh et al. (2021b)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0190) examined the effectiveness of drug candidate for COVID-19 from green tea catechins. Their docking analysis showed that **13** binds with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) with a binding energy of −7.6 Kcal/mol. This binding energy was due to the hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues Thr26, His41, Ser144, Cys145, Glu166, Gln189 and Gly143 and to polar interactions with the residues Thr24, Thr25, Thr45, Ser46, Asn142 and Gln192. Hydrophobic interactions of **13** with the Mpro amino acid residues Leu27, Met49, Leu141and Met165, were also seen ([Ghosh et al. 2021b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0190)). Also, **13** binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) with a binding energy of −5.7 Kcal/mol. This binding energy was due to hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues Lys603, Tyr606, Asp608, Pro612, Leu805, Thr806 and Tyr826 as well as hydrophobic interactions with the residues Pro612 and Lys603 ([Mhatre et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0445)) ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0015)).\nFrom the above discussion on the interaction of **12** and **13** with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro key residues His41 and/or Cys145 one can conclude that the two flavan-3-ol derivatives may inhibit the proteolitic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and they may be effective towards the COVID-19 disease treatment.\nProcyanidins, also called condensed tannins, are polymers of flavan-3-ol units which are known for their potent antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH) ([Pedan et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0520)). The potent antioxidant activity of procyanidins, extracted from _Vitis amurensis_ , is due to synergic effects of their ROS scavenging capacity and to their chelating effects on transition metals ([Lee et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0370)). Some studies suggested that the wild grape _Vitis amurensis_ procyanidins exhibit an anti-inflammatory activity ([Bak et al., 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0035), [Chen et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0080)). In fact, the pre-treatment of human adipocytes and macrophage-like cell lines with procyanidins lead to a decrease in the IL-6 and MCP-1 and an increase in the anti-inflammatory adipokine and adiponectin production, after inflammatory stimulation ([Chacón et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0070)). In addition, a treatment of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with procyanidins, extracted from _Vitis amurensis_ seeds, showed a decrease in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS, EC 1.14.13.39) expression and NOS production ([Bak et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0035)). The procyanidins decrease the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production induced by LPS. They also inhibit the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediator COX-2 ([Bak et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0035)).\nProcyanidin B1 (**14**) is a procyanidin dimer present in _Vitis amurensis_ berry ([Zhao et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0745)). It has an inhibitory potential on SARS-CoV ([Zhuang et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0770)). A recent molecular docking study of **14** on SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) showed a binding energy of −9.8 Kcal/mol. This binding energy was due to hydrogen bonds with the residues Tyr456, Thr556, Tyr619, Lys621, Thr680, Thr687, Asn691, Ser759 as well as to π and van der Walls interactions with the residues Arg555, Pro620, Asp623, Arg624, Ser682, Ala688 and Asp760 ([Iheagwam and Rotimi 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0260)). Through this study, we can assume that **14** can be implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission prevention.\nIn _Vitis amurensis_ , cyanidin-3-_O_ -glucoside (**15**) is abundant in berry ([De la Cruz et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0130)). There are several reports that mentioned its biological effects. For example, **15** displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities ([Kähkönen and Heinonen 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0300)). It provides a protection against the endothelial dysfunction and the vascular failure as well as against the myocardial damage ([Serraino et al. 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0570)). A molecular docking analysis carried out by [Islam et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0265) showed that **15** has a high binding energy (-8.4 Kcal/mol) to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) and it forms hydrogen bonds with the residues Thr26, Leu141, Gly143, Glu166, Asp187 and Gln189. In addition, **15** shows non-covalent hydrophobic interactions with the residues Met49 and Cys145. The interaction of **15** with Cys145 is the most important for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition.\n### 6.3. Stilbenes\nStilbenes are polyphenolic compounds that are widely distributed in _Vitis_ sp. ([Dubrovina and Kiselev, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0140), [Souid et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0625)). In _Vitis amurensis,_ stilbenes occur in leaf, stem and root ([Huang and Lin, 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0245), [Ha et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0215)). Over the last few years, stilbenes were extensively studied because of their important biological roles such as the prevention of LDL from oxidative processes ([Ngoc et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0455)), their hepatoprotective effects ([Oshima et al. 1995](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0490)) and their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities ([Huang et al. 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0250)).\nδ-viniferin (**16**) is a stilbene derivative that has a potent anti-viral activity against a variety of viruses such as HCV ([Lee et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0375)) and HIV ([Pflieger et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0535)). [Joshi et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295) screened **16** against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and RdRp enzymes. They showed that **16** binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) active site through π-π interaction with the catalytic residue His41 in addition to non-covalent interactions with the residues Thr24, Met49, Met165 and His163 with a binding energy of −8.4 Kcal/mol. Compound **16** binds to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 7BTF) with a binding energy of −8.3 Kcal/mol through π-anion interaction with the active site catalytic residue Asp761 and non-covalent interactions with the residues Ser514, Arg553, Asp616, Asp623, Ala762 and Trp800 ([Joshi et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295)). The intermolecular interactions of **16** with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and RdRp proteases suggest that **16** has a high potential as a ligand against SARS-CoV-2.\n### 6.4. Structure-Activity Relationships (SARS) of _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenols\nThe strongest interaction of phenolic acids with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins residues is mainly due to the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups ([Puttaswamy et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0545)).\nThe high antiviral effectiveness of the flavonols is due to the increased number of the hydroxyl groups on the B-ring. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory effect of myricetin, which has three hydroxyl groups (3′-OH, 4′-OH and 5′-OH) on the B-ring, is higher than that of quercetin which has two hydroxyl groups (4′-OH and 5′-OH) on the B-ring ([Nguyen et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0465)). Further, the flavonol compounds in aglycone forms have stronger antiviral activity than the glycosylated ones. Indeed, the glycosylation of quercetin at the 4′-position which lead to the formation the quercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide, decreases the antiviral effect of this compound. Also, the absence of the two hydroxyl groups (3′-OH and 5′-OH) on the B-ring and the glycosylation at the 4′-position of the two compounds kaempferol-3-_O_ -glucuronide and kaempferol-3-_O_ -rutinoside explain their lower antiviral capacity compared to myricetin, quercetin and quercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide ([Nguyen et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0465)).\nIn the flavanone group, the high inhibitory activity of naringenin against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme is due to the presence of the hydroxyl group on the 7-position at the A-ring ([Nguyen et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0465)).\nIn the flavan-3-ol group, the decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups lead to the decease of the antiviral effectiveness. According to [Nguyen et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0465), epigallocatechin gallate has higher SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory effect than catechin. Indeed, epigallocatechin gallate contains three hydroxyl groups (3′-OH, 4′-OH and 5′-OH) on the B-ring, however catechin contains two hydroxyl groups (3′-OH and 4′-OH). Also, the galloyl moiety at C3 in the C-ring molecule increases the effectiveness of the epigallocatechin gallate against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. [Zhu and Xie (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0760) indicated that the dimerization of the flavan-3-ols on procyanidin B increases their inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.\nBy comparing the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory effects of the flavan-3-ols and the flavonols, [Nguyen et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0465) showed that the absence of the C2-C3 double bond and the C4 carbonyl on the C-ring of the flavan-3-ols lead to lower relative activity than flavonols.\nIn the anthocyanidins group, the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of the cyaniding-3-_O_ -glucoside is mainly due to its hydroxylation ([Ghosh et al. 2021c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0195)). Also, the inhibitory activity of δ-Viniferin against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is due to the hydroxyl groups ([Joshi et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0295)).\n##  7. Pharmacokinetics prediction of potential polyphenolic compounds (_in silico_ ADMET Studies)\nThe prediction of the pharmacokinetics properties (ADMET) and the bioactivity of sixteen _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenol compounds studied in the present work are screened using _pKCSM_ ([Pires et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0540)). The molecular refractivity is predicted from _SWISSADME_ server ([Daina et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0110)). According to Lipinski, Ghose and Veber rules, the oral bioavailability of a drug depends on several properties. In fact, a drug must have a molecular weight < 500 g/mol, a logP (octanol-water partition coefficient) value < 5, hydrogen bond donors (–NH or –OH groups) < 5 and hydrogen bond acceptors (N or O atoms) < 10 ([Grant et al. 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0210)). Also, drugs should have topological polar surface area (TPSA) < 140 A2 and rotatable bonds ≤ 10 ([Lipinski et al. 1997](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0395)). The molar refractivity is an important property of drug-likeness and it must range between 40 cm3 and 130 cm3 for an acceptable oral biovailability ([Veber et al. 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0650)). Out of the 16 studied compounds, only 5 _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenols which are **3** , **4** , **6** , **11** and **12** agree with Lipinski, Veber and Ghose rules ([Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0020)) and, therefore, they represent potential orally administered drugs.\n### Table 4.\nPrediction of the molecular and drug-likeness proprieties of polyphenols derived from _Vitis amurensis._\nCompound | MW | LogP | H-Do | H-Ac | Nrot | TPSA | Mref | LV | GV | VV  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**1** | 170.120 | 0.5016 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 67.135 | 39.470 | 0 | 2 | 0  \n**2** | 302.190 | 1.1956 | 4 | 8 | 0 | 141.340 | 75.3100 | 0 | 0 | 1  \n**3** | 180.159 | 1.1960 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 74.381 | 47.160 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**4** | 194.186 | 1.4986 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 66.76 | 51.630 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**5** | 354.311 | −0.6459 | 6 | 8 | 4 | 141.587 | 83.500 | 1 | 1 | 1  \n**6** | 302.238 | 1.988 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 122.108 | 78.030 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**7** | 478.362 | −0.4466 | 8 | 12 | 4 | 188.063 | 110.770 | 2 | 1 | 1  \n**8** | 462.363 | −0.1522 | 7 | 11 | 4 | 183.269 | 108.740 | 2 | 0 | 1  \n**9** | 594.522 | −1.3927 | 9 | 15 | 6 | 236.106 | 139.360 | 3 | 4 | 1  \n**10** | 318.237 | 1.6936 | 6 | 8 | 1 | 126.902 | 80.060 | 1 | 0 | 1  \n**11** | 272.256 | 2.5099 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 114.235 | 71.570 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**12** | 290.271 | 1.5461 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 119.662 | 74.330 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n**13** | 458.375 | 2.2332 | 8 | 11 | 3 | 184.742 | 112.060 | 2 | 0 | 1  \n**14** | 578.526 | 2.995 | 10 | 12 | 3 | 236.950 | 183.510 | 3 | 2 | 1  \n**15** | 449.388 | 0.3820 | 8 | 10 | 4 | 179.740 | 108.290 | 2 | 0 | 1  \n**16** | 454.478 | 5.6506 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 195.452 | 130.240 | 0 | 1 | 0  \n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/table/t0020/)\nMW, molecular weight (g/mol); LogP , predicted octanol/water partition coefficient; H-Do, hydrogen bond donors; H-Ac, hydrogen bond acceptors; Nrot, number of rotatable bonds; TPSA, topological polar surface area (A2); Mref, Molar refractivity , LV, Lipinski violation; GV, Ghose violation; VV, Veber violation, **1** , gallic acid; **2** , ellagic acid; **3** , caffeic acid; **4** , ferulic acid; **5** , chlorogenic acid; **6** , quercetin; **7** , quercetin-3-_O_ -glucuronide: **8** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -glucuronide; **9** , kaempferol-3-_O_ -rutinoside; **10** , myricetin; **11** , naringenin; **12** , catechin; **13** , epigallocatechin gallate; **14** , procyanidin B1; **15** , cyanidin-3-_O_ -glucoside; **16** , δ-viniferin\nFurthermore, an effective drug must have good ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties at a therapeutic dose ([Lipinski et al. 1997](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0395)). Regarding the absorption parameters, the polyphenol compounds (**3** , **4** , **6** , **11** and **12**) have an optimal Caco-2 cell permeability and a good human intestinal absorption ([Table 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#t0025)). Compounds **4** , **6** , **11** and **12** are predicted to be P-glycoprotein substrates. Such drugs should be administered with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor to make easy their absorption into the cells ([Lee et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#b0375)). The drugs distribution results prove that **3** and **4** have the highest blood distribution (VDss). However, the flavonoids **6** , **11** and **12** show the lowest distribution. Compounds **3** , **4** and **11** are able to penetrate to the central nervous system (CNS) but they are poorly distributed to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The polyphenol compounds (**3** , **4** , **6** , **11** and **12**) show good metabolism since they do not express toxicity for any isoform of the cytochrome P450.

Conclusion\nCOVID-19 is an important threat to the worldwide health and safety. Therefore, it is very urgent to limit its spread and diminish the mortality rate. To overcome this threat, it is essential to control its infection source and to cut off the transmission route. In the present work, the most promising anti-viral polyphenol compounds obtained from the Chinese medicinal _Vitis amurensis_ are discussed. These compounds are expected to be potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 disease. A molecular docking indicated that these compounds have a good binding activity with the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes Mpro and RdRp. The anti-COVID-19 properties of the studied compounds are due to their structure-activity relationships that prove the significant effects of the hydroxylation pattern, the glycosylation, the galloylation and the dimerization. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the compounds; caffeic acid (**3)** , ferulic acid (**4)** , quercetin (**6)** , naringenin (**11)** and catechin (**12)** are effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 because of their drug-likeness and low toxicity. These compounds are suggested as Mpro inhibitors. Compounds **6** showed also strong binding to the RdRp ([Fig. 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/#f0025)). The present work opens up future perspectives for the _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ testing possibilities of the five _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenol compounds (**3** , **4** , **6** , **11** and **12**) against COVID-19.\n### Fig. 5.\n[![Fig. 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3425/9177455/f3736dcafcd1/gr5.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9177455_gr5.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883852/figure/f0025/)\nSchematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitory effects of some _Vitis amurensis_ polyphenols selected according to their drug-likeness characteristics [created with BioRender.com]\n##  Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n##  Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia for providing administrative and technical support.\n##  Footnotes\nPeer review under responsibility of King Saud University.\n##  Contributor Information\nImen Souid, Email: simen@kku.edu.sa.\nAtef Korchef, Email: akorchef@kku.edu.sa.\nSafouan Souid, Email: souid@bk.ru.\n##  References\n  1.

Generating accurate measurements of the appropriate clinical and epidemiological indicators associated with COVID-19 is a necessary step in reducing the current pandemic's burden on individuals and the population at large. These unprecedented times have presented a challenge to chronic desease epidemiologists and have required a practical approach “to do something to help during this disaster”. Options include returning to clinical care or resorting to online textbooks and resources for crash courses on outbreak research. However, being aware of the magnitude of individual suffering endured by so many, including many esteemed and close colleagues, becomes a personal challenge of enormous proportions. It is envisaged that the arts and other humanities can help re-establish balance, both during the pandemic and especially after it.\n**Keywords:** COVID-19, Epidemiology, Humanism, Resilience\n## Abstract\nLa rápida propagación del SARS-CoV-2 requiere la generación de evidencia para ayudar a mitigar su daño global. La medición precisa con los indicadores clínicos y epidemiológicos apropiados asociados con COVID-19 es un paso necesario para reducir la carga individual y poblacional de la pandemia en curso. Estos tiempos sin precedentes han planteado un desafío para los epidemiólogos de enfermedades crónicas, y requirió de un enfoque práctico «para hacer algo para ayudar durante este desastre». Las opciones incluían regresar a la clínica asistencial o recurrir a libros de texto y recursos en línea para un curso acelerado sobre investigación de brotes. Sin embargo, ser consciente de la magnitud del sufrimiento individual soportado por tantos, incluyendo muchos colegas estimados y cercanos, se erige como un desafío personal de enormes proporciones. Se prevé que las artes y otras formas de Humanidades pueden ayudar a restablecer el equilibrio, tanto durante la pandemia, como especialmente después.\n**Palabras clave:** COVID-19, Epidemiología, Humanismo, Resiliencia\n* * *\nGabriel García Márquez, the Colombian novelist and Nobel prize winner, suffered from cholera and many bouts of malaria during his life. In _Love in the Time of Cholera,_ one of his many masterpieces, he wrote that persistence (and hand washing!) rewarded the protagonist, Florentino Ariza, with the love of Fermina Daza after living a life with innumerable cholera outbreaks.\nI remember how nervous I was in the presence of my first patient, somewhere around my third year of medical school, during a voluntary on-call night shift at the Vall d’Hebron Hospital Emergency Department in 1982: he was a 42-year-old man with bilateral atypical pneumonia. My Attending told me, “Congratulations. You got the diagnosis right. Does anything else about this patient surprise you?”. I answered that on the complete blood count, he had zero lymphocytes and that he had a tattoo of an asterisk on the anatomical snuff box of his left hand. My Attending nodded, “Yes, he's a heroin addict with severe immunodeficiency that will kill him within 24 h. There's nothing we can do.” I think that more than half of the patients I saw during medical school were HIV/AIDS patients. Fortunately, nowadays, all of this type of patients are cured.\nI am a respiratory epidemiologist and during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were literally bombarded with descriptive epidemiology statistics and other figures that were as precise as they were cold: “To date, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide is 165,656.” “It is hoped that the maximum requirement for ventilators and ICU beds in the USA will occur on April 14, 2020…” and so on.\nIn the past, there have been devastating epidemics of other diseases: cholera, the 1918 flu (wrongly named the “Spanish flu”), the black death, AIDS, and more. Other more recent outbreaks, such as SARS, MERS, or Ebola, were considered exotic, far-away events. But no, we were not prepared for this. Considering at least the last four generations, we are certain that we are now living in unprecedented times.\nNobody, not even in the most terrible nightmare of a Hollywood sci-fi screenwriter, could have anticipated that 2020 would begin with such drama and suffering. When we were raising our glasses on New Year's Eve to toast the new year, few were aware of a health alert reported that morning in Wuhan, Hubei province (China) due to a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0065)\nJust ten days later, on January 9, 2020, the Chinese CDC reported that a novel coronavirus was the causative agent of this local outbreak. For better or for worse, the entire world is globally interconnected. Thus, this incident in China is the reason why we are living in confinement; why basic civil liberties are curtailed; why so many deaths and suffering have occurred; and why, locally, my hospital has been on the verge of collapse.\nLa Princesa Hospital, an old, 450-bed tertiary referral hospital in Madrid's Salamanca neighborhood, had its D-Day on March 30, 2020, when a total of 552 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and another 120 patients were in the Emergency Department, impatiently awaiting admission.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0070) Many of the two-bed rooms already had three, even four occupants. We had to expand our cozy but modern ICU ward from 17 to 73 beds, with the invasion of two operating theaters as well as the entire Psychiatry floor repurposed into intensive care wards.\nHarkening back to past times, we had to send all patients with mental illness home with their family members—even those with active episodes of severe paranoid schizophrenia or major depression—to make room for other patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, mostly with ventilators improvised through the reuse of disposable items or doubled-up on equipment modified with rudimentary technology. Even some friends who are veteran volunteers with _Doctors Without Borders_ in the Syrian civil war or in the Ebola zone of Sierra Leone were not prepared.\nUsing military terminology, La Princesa was a war hospital on the front lines of the battle. My Pulmonology Department, with 13 senior pneumologists plus 8 residents, had 11 “losses,” including quarantines, infections, and hospitalization with severe bilateral pneumonia. However, in other Madrid hospitals, the blow was even bigger: colleagues from La Paz Hospital or Gregorio Marañón were experiencing an even worse avalanche of patients. A true modern-day hecatomb, from the Ancient Greek έκατóν, _hekatón_ , or “hundred” and βοũς, or “oxen” a religious sacrifice of one hundred oxen to indicate a great catastrophe with high mortality or the end of the world.\nWe are still facing a cruel disease and a worldwide epidemic of biblical proportions.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0075) It is still severely affecting our elderly and those with heart, lung, or other chronic diseases. But not just them. Several of my colleagues—young, completely healthy, athletic even—have had to be hospitalized in the same ward where they were seeing patients the day before; two friends have been in the intensive care unit with tracheotomies, fighting for their lives. Why? We still do not know if an immunological, a genetic, or a combination of risk factors or serendipity make it so that this small RNA virus collapses the bronchi and lungs with a thick “mucus or snail slime” accompanied by an inflammatory cascade that kills previously healthy people.\nAs Dr. Landete explained to the junior residents during morning rounds, “This is the first time that I have seen the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) before my eyes. In the Emergency Department, I was examining a 52-year-old patient with fever, malaise, and a dry cough and in 20 minutes, I had to call an ENT colleague to intubate her; she had developed the fastest and severest ARDS I have ever seen.” Despite all their efforts and the fact she was in best hands, they could not save her. It really is a very nasty bug.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0080), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0085)\nNevertheless, there is always hope, and as can be seen in great literature, times of crisis bring out the best in all. I have seen residents choose to stay longer after being on-call for 24 h to try to save another critical patient; nursing aides improvising gowns and shoes out of trash bags who, after finally receiving their space suits, posed for posterity like a soccer team, always smiling; neurology, immunology, or pathology residents who transformed themselves into pulmonology residents; medical students who volunteered to learn practical aspects of mechanical ventilation and gas exchange; a department chief who created a blog aimed at recognizing people for their outstanding bravery and commitment. I have had the privilege of coordinating a small think tank group that includes physicians, physicists, engineers, and other friends who, since Saturday, March 14, video conference at 7:00 a.m., just before seeing patients or waking up their families, have met daily to brainstorm.\nSeveral of the professionals I have mentioned have been living in hotels next to our hospital for two or more weeks, with sleep deprivation for a month already ([Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#fig0005) ). Our medical direction recommended all personnel not to take weekends or days off until further notice. Nobody out of a staff of more than two thousand employees questioned it, not even the unions. And this has been going on for almost a month. Once again, all with a wide smile. It is what is known as the _spirit of La Princesa._\n## Figure 1.\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e338/7293479/f6cdd8614c08/gr1_lrg.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7293479_gr1_lrg.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/figure/fig0005/)\nSleep pattern of a physician during the COVID-19 outbreak in the La Princesa University Hospital, from March 13 to April 11, 2020, by Fitbit, with permission (<https://www.fitbit.com/sleep>).\nI myself, a humble respiratory epidemiologist who has devoted his professional life to research on COPD, asthma, and tobacco, had to turn to textbooks and online resources for a quick and practical immersion on infectious disease clinical practice and epidemiology and take a crash course on outbreak research: death counts, cases of infection, R0 reproduction numbers, and the like.[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0090) That was the easy part. Realizing that behind every number was a personal tragedy, a loss of a family member, little by little broke my heart and my lungs. There have been so many people who have died alone in their homes and elderly people who have died in nursing homes, without medical care, without any assistance, without anyone looking after them. I imagine that many had nobody holding their hands. In the interest of hygiene and other priorities, there was nobody available to say a prayer for them while they were buried or cremated alone. It will take some time to accept these deaths, such a cruel end for so many.\nWe must live on this planet. There is no other Earth or planet/plan B. And we have observed that air pollution and the health of the planet can improve in weeks with concerted individual and societal efforts.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0095) Children confined to their homes, for six weeks now, have valued playing with their brothers and sisters or chatting with their neighbors from balconies, even talking online with their friends and school teachers. They must be the first to be let out of confinement.\nAnd we need to learn lessons from history. This is not our first epidemic. This is the price we have to pay for living in society and in cities. If we were still hunter-gatherers in nature, this would not have happened. However, humans are social animals and, beyond our _Homo sapiens_ species, experts say we are of a subspecies called _emotionalis._ Human animals are not meant to live alone or to die alone or in solitude ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#fig0010) ).\n## Figure 2.\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e338/7293479/94b5ba03ea43/gr2_lrg.jpg)\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/figure/fig0010/)\nLoneliness.\nI have no doubt that when this crisis is over, music, theater, cinema, literature, and the arts in general will help re-establish balance and that we will all be wiser, better people.[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0100) The so-called movement from omics to humanomics.[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0105), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0110)\nBeyond modern medicine, ever more technical and robotic, medical humanism in the 21st century will be more important than ever.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0115) Pangloss, the optimistic tutor of Candide in the Voltaire's work of the same name, pontificated, “Everything happens for a reason.” And Pangloss insisted to his pupil, “Everything happens for a reason and this is the best of all possible worlds,” while poor Candide suffered a life full of calamities, which illustrates that Pangloss’ syllogism was evidently false.\nBut there is no room for pessimism. I remember having read _Essay on Blindness_ , by the Portuguese author José Saramago; happily, the generalized panic and selfishness in his outbreak of sudden blindness only occurred in literature. Imagine if Gabo would be able to be inspired by today's COVID-19 pandemic; he might rewrite his _Love in the Time of Cholera_.\nMore must-reads: _The Plague_ , by French novelist Albert Camus, who died in a car crash near Sens at the young age of 46. Camus, who was not wearing a seatbelt and was sitting in the passenger's seat, died instantly. But what a life he lived—so intense! _The Plague_ tells the story of a plague that threatens the Franco-Algerian city of Oran. However, it is not a medical book, but rather a book about human passions during and after an outbreak. I cannot wait to read it again.\nIn all these books, and in others, healthcare personnel have been legitimately portrayed and praised as heroes and martyrs. However, last but certainly not least, I would like to bring these personal reflections to an end by remembering the crucial role played by our non-healthcare hospital staff. The nursing and medical departments certainly deserve praise, as they have endured the cruelty and harshness of COVID-19.\nNevertheless, their work and efforts would be in vain without the cleaning staff, wardens, cooks, cafeteria hospitality professionals, administrators, security forces, laboratory technicians, and many other hospital workers. They too endured this modern plague, often without protection, many times without recognition, but always with pride; they worked 24/7 and, again, always with a smile. These professionals must be lauded and recognized just the same, given that without cleaning and hospitality personnel, among other colleagues, our hospitals would instantly collapse.\nAs this is not the last outbreak and in all likelihood not “the Big One” either, we need to learn one more lesson from the past.[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293479/#bib0120) In the future, we must try to never take for granted the things that, during confinement, we suddenly saw as precious: a bear hug, a pat on the back, and, of course, a big smile without a mask.\nI have no doubt that medical humanism and the arts are already helping us overcome COVID-19 and will help us learn to better care for our patients, our loved ones, and ourselves.\n##  Conflicts of interest\nThe author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.\n##  Acknowledgments\nTo Drs.
